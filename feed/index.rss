						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good Samaritans raced to help a woman and an elderly man minutes after, police said, they were <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-dade/search-underway-for-19-year-old-after-shooting-in-sw-miami-dade-leaves-1-dead-2-injured/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shot inside of a Southwest Miami-Dade home</a> during a domestic dispute that left a man dead and led to the arrest of a 19-year-old suspect.</p>
<p>Ring doorbell video captured area resident Lisa Pelaez and her husband rendering aid to a 74-year-old man moments after he fled the home, in the area of Southwest 142nd Avenue and 294th Street, Saturday morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s shooting up the house,&#8221; the man is heard saying in the video.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s still there?&#8221; asked Pelaez.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah!&#8221; said the man.</p>
<p>According to Miami-Dade Police, Ruben Warren Williams ran away after shooting three of his family members. His cousin, identified as 27-year-old Carlton Tillman, was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
<p>Detectives said four children were in the home when the shots rang out.</p>
<p>“According to investigators, there was a verbal dispute inside of the residence that escalated and led to shots fired,” said MDPD detective Khristopher Welch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were so scared,&#8221; said Pelaez.</p>
<p>Investigators said Williams&#8217; grandfather had asked him not to smoke marijuana in the house, and that led to an argument.</p>
<p>Police said Williams became angry and opened fire, striking Tillman, his grandfather and his aunt.</p>
<p>Detectives said the suspect&#8217;s aunt and grandfather jumped from a second-floor window. The grandfather broke both his ankles, and even still, both he and the suspect&#8217;s aunt ran for help.</p>
<p>Pelaez, who lives two doors down, said the older victim headed to her home.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aunt, who jumped out of the second-story building, went this way, and the grandfather went this way to my house,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I opened the door immediately. He said, &#8216;I&#8217;ve been shot. My grandson shot me; he&#8217;s shooting everybody.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Pelaez said she immediately called 911 and tried to treat his wounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;My husband ran and grabbed a towel from our closet, he put the towel on his back, on the gunshot wound,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I ran in the house, and I grabbed a chair, and we sat him down on the chair. The grandfather said, &#8216;My legs broke, my legs broke,&#8217; and I&#8217;m asking the grandfather, &#8216;Where&#8217;s the lady, where&#8217;s the lady?'&#8221;</p>
<p>Surveillance video captured Williams&#8217; aunt as she limped to a nearby home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I picked her up, and I put her to the side of the house to try and hide her body,&#8221; said a resident at this home. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know where the guy was at the time. In that short instant, the paramedics came, so they were able to take over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police said <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-dade/19-year-old-arrested-charged-with-murder-in-shooting-that-left-man-dead-2-others-injured/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Williams was arrested Saturday</a> after he hopped into a woman&#8217;s car and forced her to drive for hours at gunpoint.</p>
<p>Investigators said the suspect also shot and killed a neighbor&#8217;s dog during the rampage.</p>
<p>Neighbors said they&#8217;re thankful for Williams&#8217; quick capture.</p>
<p>&#8220;My friends and my family and I are so relieved, you do not understand,&#8221; said Pelaez.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, that&#8217;s good. Hopefully the lady survives,&#8221; said the resident who helped Williams&#8217; aunt.</p>
<p>Williams is facing multiple charges, including second-degree murder, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, child abuse and animal cruelty with intent to injure or kill.</p>
<p>As of Sunday night, police have not identified the surviving victims, who remain at Jackson South Medical Center. Their conditions are currently unknown.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FLORIDA CITY, Fla. (AP/WSVN) &#8212; A South Florida vaccination site had so few eligible takers Saturday that it started inoculating any adult who wanted a shot rather than let the vaccine on hand go to waste.</p>
<p>Word spread, and on Sunday, the Florida City site was overwhelmed, particularly after local state Sen. Annette Taddeo incorrectly tweeted that the federally run site would again take all comers. The Democrat, who was the party&#8217;s lieutenant governor candidate in 2014, later deleted that tweet and corrected herself.</p>
<p>Frustration and confusion set in among the hundreds of people who came to the site run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>
<p>Among those were Kathy Benezra.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite upset. They changed the rules in the morning,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Police had to calm the crowd when the site again enforced the state&#8217;s eligibility rules: 65 and older; frontline medical workers and police officers, teachers and firefighters over 50; and younger people with a physician&#8217;s note saying they would be endangered if they caught the virus.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article249760473.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Miami Herald</a>, a Florida City police officer through a megaphone told 200 people waiting in line, “If you do not meet the criteria, you will not be vaccinated today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people went away once they heard the criteria, but [the line] was all the way around the block,&#8221; said Benezra.</p>
<p>Benezra said she got there at around 7 a.m. because she heard the site was giving vaccinations to anyone over the age of 18 who wanted one.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been here, and now the rules have changed,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The confusion appeared to stem from what happened on Saturday.</p>
<p>Vaccines must be refrigerated at extremely cold temperatures and used that day once they are removed. Rather than letting doses go to waste, workers on Saturday reportedly began giving them out to any adult regardless of profession or medical history.</p>
<p>That is not unusual &#8211; many drugstores, for example, will inject anyone in the store at closing time if they have leftover vaccines that would spoil otherwise.</p>
<p>Word of what reportedly happened at the Florida City site quickly spread online, and people came from miles to the small town on the Florida peninsula&#8217;s southern tip to get their shots.</p>
<p>The FEMA-run site administers 500 doses per day.</p>
<p>Mike Jachles with the Florida Association of Public Information Officers issued a statement that reads in part, &#8220;The FEMA-supported sites are adhering to the governor&#8217;s most recent executive order.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many who met the eligibility requirements received their vaccine doses at the larger FEMA-run site at Miami-Dade College&#8217;s North Campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very easy, and I&#8217;m very happy to live in this country,&#8221; said patient Magda Caceres..</p>
<p>&#8220;Super quick, super easy,&#8221; said patient Viviane Carneiro.</p>
<p>Schoolteachers and school employees of all ages are also eligible at FEMA-supported sites.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once the governor opened it up to teachers, I&#8217;m like, &#8216;I&#8217;m out here as soon as I can,'&#8221; said Angel Beswick.</p>
<p>For her, the MDC site was the happiest place on Earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels like I&#8217;m at Disney World, honestly. I&#8217;m so excited,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>As the race to vaccinate continues, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava urged the governor to <a href="https://twitter.com/MayorDaniella/status/1368636288170139648?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expand eligibility requirements</a>.</p>
<p>Sunday night, state officials reported 3,878 vaccinations at the three FEMA-run sites in South Florida. Of these inoculations, 3,160 took place at the MDC North Campus site, 321 at the Florida City site and 397 at the site located in Sweetwater.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring breakers spotted without face masks at two popular South Florida destinations have raised concerns that the gatherings could lead to an increase in coronavirus cases.</p>
<p>This weekend brought <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/local-leaders-urge-spring-breakers-to-social-distance-wear-masks-as-crowds-grow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more large crowds</a> to Fort Lauderdale Beach. 7News cameras captured many revelers not wearing masks or following COVID protocols.</p>
<p>More maskless beachgoers were spotted Sunday in Miami Beach.</p>
<p>That city&#8217;s leaders are hoping to keep things calm by <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-beach-fort-lauderdale-implement-rules-and-safety-guidelines-as-spring-break-begins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closing beaches</a> at 7 p.m. and ordering businesses along the beach to shut down by midnight.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police have arrested a man in connection to the <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/woman-dies-after-shooting-in-hialeah-family-says-victims-husband-is-suspect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fatal shooting in Hialeah</a> of a woman who, her family said, was his wife.</p>
<p>Hialeah Police confirmed they took Joel Luis Polanco into custody on Saturday.</p>
<p>They had been searching for him since Friday morning, when officers responded to the home of the victim&#8217;s parentsm on the corner of East 40th Street and Seventh Avenue, and found the woman with multiple gunshot wounds. She was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
<p>Neighbors said the 40-year-old victim was a mother of two.</p>
<p>Police have not released her identity, but her brother identified her as Jozory Carida Espinosa.</p>
<p>Espinosa&#8217;s family said she had been married to Polanco for 15 years, and the shooting stemmed over their divorce.</p>
<p>Polanco is facing a first-degree murder charge and is being held without bond at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The owner of a freight forwarding business in Doral is reeling hours after thieves were caught on surveillance video driving away with a 23-foot boat in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Nelson Gonzalez of MVP International Freight Systems spoke with 7News on Saturday about the overnight theft of a 23-foot Robalo.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was actually shipping to our customer in Aruba,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a big deal to a big customer, and not only that; in these trying times, freight forwarding has suffered a lot. This affects us a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gonzalez said he left the family-owned business at around midnight on Friday, and not long after, someone started scoping it out.</p>
<p>About an hour and a half later, Gonzalez said, the crooks made their move.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thank God we had cameras, and we have cameras from different angles in every single part of this warehouse, so we were able to take pictures and post them out,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The surveillance video captured a pickup truck backing up. Someone is seen getting out and hitching the boat onto the truck.</p>
<p>Three minutes later, the thieves drove off with the boat in tow.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw that it&#8217;s a Ford F-150 extended cab &#8212; it&#8217;s a workman&#8217;s truck &#8212; and it had a spotter,&#8221; said Gonzalez, &#8220;so a spotter was actually spotting with them, and he was driving a Ford Focus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Gonzalez is hoping someone is able to get the vessel back where it belongs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all trying to feed our families. We&#8217;re all trying to keep our employees afloat, so any business, anything that we get, we have to make the best out of it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and this is not just a hard blow to us. This also [affects] our customers who live on the islands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gonzalez said his customer in Aruba is now out about $12,000.</p>
<p>If you have any information on this theft, call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS. Remember, you can always remain anonymous, and you may be eligible for a $1,000 reward.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A Minneapolis police officer was swiftly fired and charged with murder after bystander video showed him pressing his knee into George Floyd&#8217;s...]]></description>
						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A Minneapolis police officer was swiftly fired and charged with murder after bystander video showed him pressing his knee into George Floyd&#8217;s neck, ignoring the Black man&#8217;s cries that he couldn&#8217;t breathe. But even with that powerful footage, legal experts say the case isn&#8217;t a slam dunk.</p>
<p>Jury selection begins Monday in Derek Chauvin&#8217;s trial, which is expected to come down to two key questions: Did Chauvin&#8217;s actions cause Floyd&#8217;s death, and were his actions reasonable?</p>
<p>“It’s hard not to watch the video and conclude that the prosecutors will not have any trouble with this case,” said Susan Gaertner, the former head prosecutor in neighboring Ramsey County. “But it’s not that simple.”</p>
<p>Floyd was declared dead May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/us-world/prosecutors-officer-was-on-floyds-neck-for-about-9-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for about nine minutes</a>, holding his position even after Floyd went limp as he was handcuffed and lying on his stomach. Floyd’s death sparked sometimes violent protests in Minneapolis and beyond, and led to a nationwide reckoning on race.</p>
<p>Chauvin is charged with second-degree unintentional murder and second-degree manslaughter, and a panel of appeals court judges ruled Friday that the judge must consider reinstating a third-degree murder charge that he dismissed last fall. Three other officers, all of whom also were fired, face trial in August on charges of aiding and abetting the second-degree murder and manslaughter counts.</p>
<p>The second-degree murder charge requires prosecutors to prove Chauvin caused Floyd&#8217;s death while committing or trying to commit a felony — in this case, third-degree assault. The manslaughter charge has a lower bar, requiring proof that Chauvin caused Floyd&#8217;s death through negligence that created an unreasonable risk, and consciously took the chance of causing severe injury or death.</p>
<p>Exactly how Floyd died is shaping up as a major flashpoint of the trial.</p>
<p>Chauvin&#8217;s attorney, Eric Nelson, argues in court documents that Floyd likely died from fentanyl he consumed, or a combination of fentanyl, methamphetamine and underlying health conditions — not as a result of Chauvin&#8217;s knee on his neck.</p>
<p>But Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill wrote last fall that for the second-degree murder charge, prosecutors don&#8217;t have to prove that Chauvin was the sole cause of Floyd&#8217;s death — only that his conduct was a “substantial causal factor.”</p>
<p>Still, defense attorneys who aren&#8217;t connected to the case say all Nelson has to do is raise reasonable doubt in a single juror&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>“Although he had him pinned under his knee and he’s yelling ‘I can’t breathe! I can’t breathe!’ there’s an argument that (Chauvin) wasn’t exerting pressure and his inability to breathe was due to the drugs in his system or something to that effect, or his anxiety,” said F. Clayton Tyler, a prominent local defense attorney.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys say it also may not be easy to establish that Chauvin was committing the felony of assault — as required for the second-degree murder charge in this case. That&#8217;s because Chauvin is authorized to use force as a police officer, and his attorneys will argue that his use of force against Floyd was reasonable.</p>
<p>Gaertner said the defense will face a challenge of trying to move the jury’s focus off of the video and the strong emotion it generates. They&#8217;ll instead try to focus on the medical evidence and Floyd’s underlying conditions while trying to portray the circumstances of the arrest as “justifiable consistent with police norms,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Brandt and Tyler said Chauvin will likely have to take the stand to explain why he felt he had to hold Floyd down for so long. Brandt said he’ll likely say he followed his training, and that it was necessary because his experience with other suspects under the influence of drugs shows that things can suddenly become erratic and dangerous.</p>
<p>Prosecutors, however, have submitted a list of previous instances in which Chauvin used chokeholds or similar restraints on the job. Cahill ruled they can admit only one as evidence: a 2017 arrest in which Chauvin restrained a female by placing his knee on her neck while she was prone on the ground.</p>
<p>Cahill also ruled that prosecutors can tell jurors about a 2015 incident in which Chauvin saw other officers place a suicidal, intoxicated male in a side-recovery position after using a stun gun on him. Cahill said prosecutors can introduce that if they can show Chauvin was present when a medical professional said that the male could have died if officers had prolonged the detention.</p>
<p>Brandt said telling the jury about those events will allow prosecutors to show that Chauvin knew the proper way to restrain someone and provide relief, and that he had done it wrong before.</p>
<p>Brandt said the third-degree murder charge could be easier for prosecutors to prove if it&#8217;s reinstated because they wouldn&#8217;t have to show Chauvin intended to commit assault. Instead, they must prove his actions caused Floyd&#8217;s death, and that they were reckless and without regard for human life.</p>
<p>The second-degree manslaughter count alleges Chauvin took a risk that a reasonable person would have known could cause death. To defend against that, Brandt said, Chauvin could argue that he had used the same hold in the past and didn&#8217;t think it would cause a problem.</p>
<p>However, Brandt said “the whole case” against Chauvin is the video capturing the amount of time he restrained Floyd.</p>
<p>“You hear on the video the passersby, the onlookers saying, ‘Dude, he can’t breathe. Let him up. What are you doing? You are killing him,’” Brandt said. “I mean, it’s almost like they are giving a play-by-play.”</p>
<p>Tyler said if he were a prosecutor, he’d use a still shot of Chauvin’s expressionless face from that video and keep it in view for the jury to see.</p>
<p>“I mean, the look on his face,” Tyler said. “If I was prosecuting this case, I have to say, I’d have that picture up there. You want to show indifference? Just look at him.”</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(CNN) &#8212; Online platforms directed by Russian intelligence are spreading disinformation about two of the coronavirus vaccines being used in the US, a State Department spokesperson confirmed to CNN on Sunday.</p>
<p>The agency&#8217;s Global Engagement Center identified three Russian outlets &#8212; News Front, New Eastern Outlook and Oriental Review &#8212; that are spreading not only misinformation about the virus, but also regarding &#8220;international organizations, military conflicts, protests; and any divisive issue that they can exploit,&#8221; according to the spokesperson.</p>
<p>&#8220;These sites all vary in their reach, tone, and audience &#8212; but they all are spreading Russian propaganda and disinformation. The State Department&#8217;s finding of a link between these sites and Russian Intelligence is a result of a joint interagency conclusion,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The GEC leads efforts &#8220;to recognize, understand, expose, and counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts aimed at undermining or influencing the policies, security, or stability of the United States, its allies, and partner nations,&#8221; according to its website.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-disinformation-campaign-aims-to-undermine-confidence-in-pfizer-other-covid-19-vaccines-u-s-officials-say-11615129200" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wall Street Journal </a>first reported on the disinformation.</p>
<p>The campaign comes as the US and other countries race to vaccinate people using three vaccines developed in record time by the drug makers Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson. US officials have been working to increase confidence in the drugs in recent months as studies showed a concerning level of vaccine hesitancy among some people, though that has decreased as the rollout has progressed.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Kremlin denied to the Journal that the country&#8217;s intelligence services were spearheading the disinformation campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nonsense. Russian special services have nothing to do with any criticism against vaccines,&#8221; the spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told the newspaper.</p>
<p>The Journal reported that, &#8220;Russian state media and Russian government Twitter accounts have made overt efforts to raise concerns about the cost and safety of the Pfizer vaccine in what experts outside the US government say is an effort to promote the sale of Russia&#8217;s rival Sputnik V vaccine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The emphasis on denigrating Pfizer is likely due to its status as the first vaccine besides Sputnik V to see mass use, resulting in a greater potential threat to Sputnik&#8217;s market dominance,&#8221; a forthcoming report by the Alliance for Securing Democracy says, according to the Journal.</p>
<p>One outlet in the disinformation campaign, News Front, used international reports to play &#8220;up the risk that a person who receives the Pfizer or Moderna Inc. vaccines could contract Bell&#8217;s palsy, in which facial muscles are paralyzed,&#8221; according to the Journal, which noted that while a small number of side effects have been reported by vaccine recipients, the shots are overwhelmingly safe and effective.</p>
<p>Pamela Eisele, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, told the newspaper that so far, &#8220;millions of people have been vaccinated with our vaccine following the endorsement of regulators in multiple countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Moderna didn&#8217;t immediately respond to the Journal&#8217;s request for comment.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FLORIDA CITY, Fla. (AP/WSVN) &#8212; A South Florida vaccination site had so few eligible takers Saturday that it started inoculating any adult who wanted a shot rather than let the vaccine on hand go to waste.</p>
<p>Word spread, and on Sunday, the Florida City site was overwhelmed, particularly after local state Sen. Annette Taddeo incorrectly tweeted that the federally run site would again take all comers. The Democrat, who was the party&#8217;s lieutenant governor candidate in 2014, later deleted that tweet and corrected herself.</p>
<p>Frustration and confusion set in among the hundreds of people who came to the site run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>
<p>Among those were Kathy Benezra.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite upset. They changed the rules in the morning,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Police had to calm the crowd when the site again enforced the state&#8217;s eligibility rules: 65 and older; frontline medical workers and police officers, teachers and firefighters over 50; and younger people with a physician&#8217;s note saying they would be endangered if they caught the virus.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article249760473.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Miami Herald</a>, a Florida City police officer through a megaphone told 200 people waiting in line, “If you do not meet the criteria, you will not be vaccinated today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people went away once they heard the criteria, but [the line] was all the way around the block,&#8221; said Benezra.</p>
<p>Benezra said she got there at around 7 a.m. because she heard the site was giving vaccinations to anyone over the age of 18 who wanted one.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been here, and now the rules have changed,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The confusion appeared to stem from what happened on Saturday.</p>
<p>Vaccines must be refrigerated at extremely cold temperatures and used that day once they are removed. Rather than letting doses go to waste, workers on Saturday reportedly began giving them out to any adult regardless of profession or medical history.</p>
<p>That is not unusual &#8211; many drugstores, for example, will inject anyone in the store at closing time if they have leftover vaccines that would spoil otherwise.</p>
<p>Word of what reportedly happened at the Florida City site quickly spread online, and people came from miles to the small town on the Florida peninsula&#8217;s southern tip to get their shots.</p>
<p>The FEMA-run site administers 500 doses per day.</p>
<p>Mike Jachles with the Florida Association of Public Information Officers issued a statement that reads in part, &#8220;The FEMA-supported sites are adhering to the governor&#8217;s most recent executive order.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many who met the eligibility requirements received their vaccine doses at the larger FEMA-run site at Miami-Dade College&#8217;s North Campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very easy, and I&#8217;m very happy to live in this country,&#8221; said patient Magda Caceres..</p>
<p>&#8220;Super quick, super easy,&#8221; said patient Viviane Carneiro.</p>
<p>Schoolteachers and school employees of all ages are also eligible at FEMA-supported sites.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once the governor opened it up to teachers, I&#8217;m like, &#8216;I&#8217;m out here as soon as I can,'&#8221; said Angel Beswick.</p>
<p>For her, the MDC site was the happiest place on Earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels like I&#8217;m at Disney World, honestly. I&#8217;m so excited,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>As the race to vaccinate continues, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava urged the governor to <a href="https://twitter.com/MayorDaniella/status/1368636288170139648?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expand eligibility requirements</a>.</p>
<p>Sunday night, state officials reported 3,878 vaccinations at the three FEMA-run sites in South Florida. Of these inoculations, 3,160 took place at the MDC North Campus site, 321 at the Florida City site and 397 at the site located in Sweetwater.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JACKSON, Mississippi (AP) — Leo Carney worries that bigger crowds and mask-less diners could endanger workers at the Biloxi, Mississippi, seafood restaurant where he manages the kitchen. Maribel Cornejo, who earns $9.85 an hour as a McDonald&#8217;s cook in Houston, can&#8217;t afford to get sick and frets co-workers will become more lax about wearing masks, even though the fast food company requires them.</p>
<p>As more jurisdictions join Texas, Mississippi and other states in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/texas-other-states-ease-covid-19-restrictions-af9fc214690270fe617864abc772ecce">lifting mask mandates</a> and easing restrictions on businesses, many essential workers — including bartenders, restaurant servers and retail workers — are relieved by changes that might help the economy but also concerned they could <a href="https://apnews.com/article/rochelle-walensky-coronavirus-pandemic-fe2e65c19506b99ebdb8f1e0badc846b">make them less safe</a> amid a pandemic that health experts warn is far from over.</p>
<p>Many business owners on the Mississippi Gulf Coast were glad Gov. Tate Reeves decided to eliminate mask requirements, limits on seating in restaurants and most other binding restrictions. “But the workers themselves&#8230; especially ones that have pre-existing conditions, they’re scared right now,” Carney said.</p>
<p>“This just puts us back in a situation where we’re on the frontlines, under the gun again,” said Carney, who sees Black Mississippians facing the greatest risks from the decision that took effect Wednesday. COVID-19 has disproportionately affected Black and Latino people in the United States, and many Gulf Coast restaurants have a significant number of Black employees.</p>
<p>Public health experts tracking the trajectory of more contagious virus variants have warned that lifting restrictions too soon could lead to another lethal wave of infections. Although vaccination drives are accelerating as drug manufacturers ramp up production, many essential workers are not yet eligible for COVID-19 vaccines in Mississippi and other states.</p>
<p>Alabama’s state health officer on Friday advised residents to keep following standard infection-prevention recommendations even though the governor is letting the state’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kay-ivey-extends-alabama-mask-order-coronavirus-bd11f67b77915a7cd9320b714f222869">mask mandate expire </a>next month.</p>
<p>“There is nothing magical about the date of April 9. We don’t want the public to think that’s the day we all stop taking precautions,” State Health Officer Scott Harris said.</p>
<p>The governors of Iowa, Montana, North Dakota also have ended mask requirements or plan to suspend them soon. The governor of South Carolina on Friday lifted an executive order requiring face coverings in government office buildings and restaurants, leaving it up to state administrators and restaurant operators to develop their own guidelines.</p>
<p>Governors in several other states, including Michigan and Louisiana, eased the operating limits for bars, restaurants and other businesses in recent days.</p>
<p>The National Retail Federation, the largest retail trade association in the U.S., issued a statement Wednesday encouraging shoppers to wear masks. Some retail chains, including Target and supermarket operator Albertson&#8217;s, plan to continue requiring them for both customers and workers in states that no longer make them mandatory.</p>
<p>Texas Retailers Association President and CEO George Kelemen said he thinks many members will continue to require workers — but not necessarily customers — to wear masks and other protective gear.</p>
<p>“Retailers know their customers best,” he said.</p>
<p>McDonald’s cook Cornejo, 43, said the end of Texas’ mask mandate next week alarms her because several of her co-workers already were lax about keeping their faces covered. She said co-workers she has asked to pull their masks back over their noses politely acquiesced, but not always for long.</p>
<p>“There are just different attitudes,” said Cornejo, whose 19-year-old son began working as a cashier at the same restaurant to help pay the family’s bills. “Some say it’s just too difficult to keep it on for eight hours, especially when it gets hot.”</p>
<p>The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, encouraged Americans to “do the right thing” by continuing to abide by recommendations for routine mask use and social distancing &#8211; even if their states lift restrictions.</p>
<p>Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, said individuals who wear masks still risk infection from unmasked shoppers and diners. He called Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s decision to lift COVID-19 restrictions starting March 10 “entirely too soon and entirely too carefree.”</p>
<p>While deaths and new confirmed cases have plummeted from their January peaks nationwide, they’re still running at high levels, while outbreak indicators in some states have risen in recent weeks. In Mississippi, for example, the 7-day rolling average of the virus positivity rate rose from 11.47% on Feb. 19 to 12.14% on March 5, and the state&#8217;s 7-day rolling average of daily deaths increase during the same period from 15 per day to 20.71 per day.</p>
<p>Workers in cities that still have mask mandates or jobs at businesses that maintain their own virus-prevention rules anticipate defiance from customers emboldened by their governors’ actions and weary of taking precautions.</p>
<p>Molly Brooks, 25, a barista at a Farmers Branch, Texas, coffee shop, said she has regularly dealt with customers who walked out or bullied her and her colleagues when they were asked to wear a mask. Brooks worries how they&#8217;re going to enforce the rule, which the coffee shop plans to keep in place, now that Texas&#8217; governor lifted the statewide mask mandate.</p>
<p>“We are gearing up for the emotional toll that this is going to take,” said the 25-year-old barista, who started working for the coffee shop in November while looking for a job in education. “The people who don&#8217;t want to wear them are still going to fight&#8230;and now they are going to have even more ammunition.”</p>
<p>Square Books in Oxford, Mississippi, home of the University of Mississippi, will require masks and allow only eight customers at a time. Although General Manager Lyn Roberts believes the rules will make many customers feel safe, bookstore employee Paul Fyke said he observed a change in Oxford almost as soon as the Board of Aldermen chose to follow the governor&#8217;s lead and did away with the college town&#8217;s mask mandate.</p>
<p>“I mean, really, even on the drive home, you can kind of already see there were places where, for a lot of people, it was triumph,” he said on Thursday, the day after Oxford&#8217;s mask requirement ended. “They were happy to be removing them.”</p>
<p>Still, some workers are cautiously hopeful that fewer restrictions will bring more customers, tips and job security after a year short on all three.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, where the mayor last week announced the return of indoor dining and the reopening of movie theaters and gyms, Dino Keres had no qualms about serving drinks to customers bellying up to the bar inside Sam&#8217;s Grill.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s partly because he was about to get his second vaccine dose, but also because nobody on staff was infected when indoor dining was briefly permitted last fall. What’s more, masks are required unless people are eating, and indoor seating is limited to 25% of capacity.</p>
<p>“We have already went through this once, and now the timing feels about right to try it again,” Keres said Thursday.</p>
<p>Ro Hart, an assistant general manager and hostess at Tony’s Pizza Napoletana in San Francisco, said the return of indoor dining in the city provoked a mixture of joy and anxiety.</p>
<p>“We are happy to be bringing in more revenue, but we are little nervous, too, because we have to be more stringent about making sure everyone keeps their masks on when they’re not eating,” Hart said, adding that she would be far more worried if San Francisco didn&#8217;t require masks.</p>
<p>“We feel for our brothers and sisters at all those restaurants in Texas,” she said.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DELRAY BEACH, Fla. (WSVN) &#8212; A parade in Palm Beach County served as a special salute for seven veterans who were unable to go on an annual flight to the nation capital due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Palm Beach County Sheriff&#8217;s deputies and fire rescue vehicles took part in a caravan that drove past the veterans&#8217; homes, Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Honor Flight South Florida aimed to ensure some of the nation&#8217;s oldest veterans had an unforgettable reminder of how grateful people are for their service.</p>
<p>The vets were supposed to be passengers on an Honor Flight to Washington, D.C. last year. They would have had the chance to visit memorials that were built in honor of them and their fallen comrades.</p>
<p>But their trip was postponed due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>U.S. Army Lt. Col. Bill Schwartz, a World War II vet, was the parade&#8217;s grand marshal.</p>
<p>&#8220;To see this kind of a welcome, I mean, it&#8217;s overbearing, and it&#8217;s wonderful,&#8221; he said, &#8220;It&#8217;s a little icing on the cake for those who served.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schwartz was part of the first wave on Normandy Beach and one of the few to survive that D-Day battle.</p>
<p>The caravan started in Delray Beach and stopped at the homes of the veterans in the Boca Raton area, where their families and neighbors gathered to join in the celebration.</p>
<p>Honor Flight South Florida plans on a few more honor parades to pay tribute to more veterans who had to have their Honor Flights postponed.</p>
<p>The organization plans to bring back Honor Flights later in 2021, with the first ones scheduled to go out in September.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good Samaritans raced to help a woman and an elderly man minutes after, police said, they were <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-dade/search-underway-for-19-year-old-after-shooting-in-sw-miami-dade-leaves-1-dead-2-injured/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shot inside of a Southwest Miami-Dade home</a> during a domestic dispute that left a man dead and led to the arrest of a 19-year-old suspect.</p>
<p>Ring doorbell video captured area resident Lisa Pelaez and her husband rendering aid to a 74-year-old man moments after he fled the home, in the area of Southwest 142nd Avenue and 294th Street, Saturday morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s shooting up the house,&#8221; the man is heard saying in the video.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s still there?&#8221; asked Pelaez.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah!&#8221; said the man.</p>
<p>According to Miami-Dade Police, Ruben Warren Williams ran away after shooting three of his family members. His cousin, identified as 27-year-old Carlton Tillman, was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
<p>Detectives said four children were in the home when the shots rang out.</p>
<p>“According to investigators, there was a verbal dispute inside of the residence that escalated and led to shots fired,” said MDPD detective Khristopher Welch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were so scared,&#8221; said Pelaez.</p>
<p>Investigators said Williams&#8217; grandfather had asked him not to smoke marijuana in the house, and that led to an argument.</p>
<p>Police said Williams became angry and opened fire, striking Tillman, his grandfather and his aunt.</p>
<p>Detectives said the suspect&#8217;s aunt and grandfather jumped from a second-floor window. The grandfather broke both his ankles, and even still, both he and the suspect&#8217;s aunt ran for help.</p>
<p>Pelaez, who lives two doors down, said the older victim headed to her home.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aunt, who jumped out of the second-story building, went this way, and the grandfather went this way to my house,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I opened the door immediately. He said, &#8216;I&#8217;ve been shot. My grandson shot me; he&#8217;s shooting everybody.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Pelaez said she immediately called 911 and tried to treat his wounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;My husband ran and grabbed a towel from our closet, he put the towel on his back, on the gunshot wound,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I ran in the house, and I grabbed a chair, and we sat him down on the chair. The grandfather said, &#8216;My legs broke, my legs broke,&#8217; and I&#8217;m asking the grandfather, &#8216;Where&#8217;s the lady, where&#8217;s the lady?'&#8221;</p>
<p>Surveillance video captured Williams&#8217; aunt as she limped to a nearby home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I picked her up, and I put her to the side of the house to try and hide her body,&#8221; said a resident at this home. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know where the guy was at the time. In that short instant, the paramedics came, so they were able to take over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police said <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-dade/19-year-old-arrested-charged-with-murder-in-shooting-that-left-man-dead-2-others-injured/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Williams was arrested Saturday</a> after he hopped into a woman&#8217;s car and forced her to drive for hours at gunpoint.</p>
<p>Investigators said the suspect also shot and killed a neighbor&#8217;s dog during the rampage.</p>
<p>Neighbors said they&#8217;re thankful for Williams&#8217; quick capture.</p>
<p>&#8220;My friends and my family and I are so relieved, you do not understand,&#8221; said Pelaez.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, that&#8217;s good. Hopefully the lady survives,&#8221; said the resident who helped Williams&#8217; aunt.</p>
<p>Williams is facing multiple charges, including second-degree murder, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, child abuse and animal cruelty with intent to injure or kill.</p>
<p>As of Sunday night, police have not identified the surviving victims, who remain at Jackson South Medical Center. Their conditions are currently unknown.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring breakers spotted without face masks at two popular South Florida destinations have raised concerns that the gatherings could lead to an increase in coronavirus cases.</p>
<p>This weekend brought <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/local-leaders-urge-spring-breakers-to-social-distance-wear-masks-as-crowds-grow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more large crowds</a> to Fort Lauderdale Beach. 7News cameras captured many revelers not wearing masks or following COVID protocols.</p>
<p>More maskless beachgoers were spotted Sunday in Miami Beach.</p>
<p>That city&#8217;s leaders are hoping to keep things calm by <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-beach-fort-lauderdale-implement-rules-and-safety-guidelines-as-spring-break-begins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closing beaches</a> at 7 p.m. and ordering businesses along the beach to shut down by midnight.</p>
<p>Anyone with questions and concerns about the coronavirus can call the Florida Department of Health&#8217;s 24-hour hotline at 1-866-779-6121.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police have arrested a 19-year-old man in connection to a <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-dade/search-underway-for-19-year-old-after-shooting-in-sw-miami-dade-leaves-1-dead-2-injured/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shooting at a Southwest Miami-Dade home</a> that left a man dead and sent a woman and an elderly man to the hospital.</p>
<p>According to Miami-Dade Police, Ruben Warren Williams opened fire during an argument at a home in the area of Southwest 142nd Avenue and 294th Street, just after 11:15 a.m., Saturday.</p>
<p>Police and fire rescue crews responded to the neighborhood to find three victims suffering from gunshot wounds. One of them, later identified as 27-year-old Carlton Tillman, was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>Police said the two other victims, a 74-year-old man and a woman, jumped from a second-story window and ran to area homes where good Samaritans rendered aid before crews arrived and took over.</p>
<p>Paramedics airlifted the surviving victims to Jackson South Medical Center in critical condition.</p>
<p>Officials said two firearms were recovered at the scene.</p>
<p>Police took Williams into custody late Saturday night. He is facing multiple charges, including second-degree murder, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, child abuse and animal cruelty with intent to injure or kill.</p>
<p>As of Sunday afternoon, police have not identified the surviving victims.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring breakers spotted without face masks at two popular South Florida destinations have raised concerns that the gatherings could lead to an increase in coronavirus cases.</p>
<p>This weekend brought <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/local-leaders-urge-spring-breakers-to-social-distance-wear-masks-as-crowds-grow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more large crowds</a> to Fort Lauderdale Beach. 7News cameras captured many revelers not wearing masks or following COVID protocols.</p>
<p>More maskless beachgoers were spotted Sunday in Miami Beach.</p>
<p>That city&#8217;s leaders are hoping to keep things calm by <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-beach-fort-lauderdale-implement-rules-and-safety-guidelines-as-spring-break-begins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closing beaches</a> at 7 p.m. and ordering businesses along the beach to shut down by midnight.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2021 Broward Heart Walk Digital Experience kicked off this weekend at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale.</p>
<p>The events local sponsors &#8212; City Furniture, Cleveland Clinic Florida and Rick Case Automotive Group &#8212; raised money for a good cause.</p>
<p>The walk benefits the American Heart Association, a nonprofit that funds research and helps bring awareness to cardiovascular issues.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re hoping that the Broward Heart Walk will raise over $1.5 million this year for The American Heart Association,&#8221; said Andrew Koenig, president of City Furniture. &#8220;They&#8217;re going to put that money to great use: for life-saving research, very critical important awareness, to really save lives, and create happier and healthier lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s event was held in memory of Rick Case. The late community leader helped the Heart Walk reach fundraising goals for many years.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FLORIDA CITY, Fla. (AP/WSVN) &#8212; A South Florida vaccination site had so few eligible takers Saturday that it started inoculating any adult who wanted a shot rather than let the vaccine on hand go to waste.</p>
<p>Word spread, and on Sunday, the Florida City site was overwhelmed, particularly after local state Sen. Annette Taddeo incorrectly tweeted that the federally run site would again take all comers. The Democrat, who was the party&#8217;s lieutenant governor candidate in 2014, later deleted that tweet and corrected herself.</p>
<p>Frustration and confusion set in among the hundreds of people who came to the site run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>
<p>Among those were Kathy Benezra.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite upset. They changed the rules in the morning,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Police had to calm the crowd when the site again enforced the state&#8217;s eligibility rules: 65 and older; frontline medical workers and police officers, teachers and firefighters over 50; and younger people with a physician&#8217;s note saying they would be endangered if they caught the virus.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article249760473.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Miami Herald</a>, a Florida City police officer through a megaphone told 200 people waiting in line, “If you do not meet the criteria, you will not be vaccinated today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people went away once they heard the criteria, but [the line] was all the way around the block,&#8221; said Benezra.</p>
<p>Benezra said she got there at around 7 a.m. because she heard the site was giving vaccinations to anyone over the age of 18 who wanted one.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been here, and now the rules have changed,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The confusion appeared to stem from what happened on Saturday.</p>
<p>Vaccines must be refrigerated at extremely cold temperatures and used that day once they are removed. Rather than letting doses go to waste, workers on Saturday reportedly began giving them out to any adult regardless of profession or medical history.</p>
<p>That is not unusual &#8211; many drugstores, for example, will inject anyone in the store at closing time if they have leftover vaccines that would spoil otherwise.</p>
<p>Word of what reportedly happened at the Florida City site quickly spread online, and people came from miles to the small town on the Florida peninsula&#8217;s southern tip to get their shots.</p>
<p>The FEMA-run site administers 500 doses per day.</p>
<p>Mike Jachles with the Florida Association of Public Information Officers issued a statement that reads in part, &#8220;The FEMA-supported sites are adhering to the governor&#8217;s most recent executive order.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many who met the eligibility requirements received their vaccine doses at the larger FEMA-run site at Miami-Dade College&#8217;s North Campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very easy, and I&#8217;m very happy to live in this country,&#8221; said patient Magda Caceres..</p>
<p>&#8220;Super quick, super easy,&#8221; said patient Viviane Carneiro.</p>
<p>Schoolteachers and school employees of all ages are also eligible at FEMA-supported sites.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once the governor opened it up to teachers, I&#8217;m like, &#8216;I&#8217;m out here as soon as I can,'&#8221; said Angel Beswick.</p>
<p>For her, the MDC site was the happiest place on Earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels like I&#8217;m at Disney World, honestly. I&#8217;m so excited,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>As the race to vaccinate continues, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava urged the governor to <a href="https://twitter.com/MayorDaniella/status/1368636288170139648?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expand eligibility requirements</a>.</p>
<p>Sunday night, state officials reported 3,878 vaccinations at the three FEMA-run sites in South Florida. Of these inoculations, 3,160 took place at the MDC North Campus site, 321 at the Florida City site and 397 at the site located in Sweetwater.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JUNO BEACH, Fla. (AP) — On a random Thursday night, restaurant server Kimberly Filion got the surprise of her life, not once but twice: two staggeringly high tips on otherwise modest checks. The tips, inspired by a national tip-off challenge that started among rival college basketball fans in Cincinnati, totaled to $2,800.</p>
<p>Filion, a single mother of four who has worked at Kirby’s Sports Grille in Juno Beach for the past six years, had never heard of the Crosstown Tip-Off Challenge that has revved up fans of University of Cincinnati and Xavier University since an Xavier Musketeers fan left a $1,000 tip at a local burger joint in January. Last week, a UC Bearcats fan in Wyoming, Ohio, left a $7,000 tip on a $65 check at a local Italian café.</p>
<p>The Juno Beach server learned about the challenge from a customer on that Thursday night, Feb. 18. Filion was fascinated, not only because she was a struggling server but because she had a personal connection to Ohio &#8212; she is a graduate of Ohio State University. She mentioned that in passing to the customer.</p>
<p>“And then he leaves a $1,300 tip on a $30 tab,” says Filion, 45, who also serves as Kirby’s bar manager.</p>
<p>The exact check amount was $29.71, but the server’s eyes went to the handwritten total &#8212; $1,329.71 &#8212; and the note scribbled beneath it, saying “Go XU!!”</p>
<p>The customer left another note as well: “Five Kelley Boys love Kirby’s in Juno Beach, FL! They cook your catch! Let’s go XU nation! Let’s get this to the national level!”</p>
<p>Filion says she ran after the customer when she saw the tip, but he was gone.</p>
<p>Floored, she recounted the incident later that evening to one of her regular customers. The guy had no particular loyalty to Xavier or to U.C., but he’s a big fan of Kirby’s bar. When Filion reviewed his check, she got her second shock of the night: a $1,500 tip on a $78 tab.</p>
<p>“He wrote something like, ‘I want to be the king,’” she says.</p>
<p>HELPING OTHERS</p>
<p>Filion shared her news with coworkers. Then she shared her tips with them.</p>
<p>“I tried to spread the wealth as much as I could,” she says. “We have employees here who are single moms. We have one employee who just had a baby.”</p>
<p>She knows their daily challenges have been made more severe during the pandemic. She knows this because this has been her struggle as well.</p>
<p>By the time her first big-tipping customer had taken his seat at Kirby’s bar that Thursday, Filion had run the daily marathon that is her life. She had made breakfast for her school-age kids, packed their lunches, spirited them to different schools, all on less than five hours of sleep.</p>
<p>As she does most days, the single mother of four raced through it all before heading in for her shift, which can run as late at 1:30 a.m.</p>
<p>Her boss, Sean Kirby, describes her as an “awesome” employee and “a hard worker.” And Filion says she loves her job.</p>
<p>“We have the most amazing, loyal customers ever. They make coming in so worthwhile,” says Filion.</p>
<p>The pay, however, doesn’t always love her back. She earns less than $5.40 an hour and relies on tips to boost her take-home pay to at least minimum-wage levels.</p>
<p>On the night of Feb. 18, the friendly customer at the bar asked her how business was going. Filion told him times were tough for the industry. She’s not one to chatter on about her woes to a customer. In fact, she sometimes refers to herself as “the therapist,” a sympathetic ear ready to listen to her customers vent. But that night, she vented a bit herself when the customer asked how things were.</p>
<p>“Everyone’s hurting. Honestly, I’m exhausted. I’m putting orange juice in my kids’ cereal,” she recalls telling the customer.</p>
<p>Kirby’s is a go-to neighborhood pub that’s locally famous for its meaty, Maryland-style crab cakes. The welcoming spot has been around for 17 years, but like many restaurants across the country, Kirby’s has lost a considerable amount of its dine-in crowd. The pub’s owner says the influx of newcomers moving to the area from the north is not translating into more customers.</p>
<p>“They’ll come to Florida. We see the traffic. But they’re not getting out,” says Kirby. “This is supposed to be our busiest time of the year.”</p>
<p>The pub has stepped up its takeout service and is expected to undergo renovations to create an open-sided dining area, he says.</p>
<p>But even as they pack more meals to go for takeout customers, servers like Filion too often see nothing for it in their take-home pay.</p>
<p>“You’d be surprised how many people don’t even leave a dollar &#8212; not one dollar &#8212; when they pick up their order. People are clueless sometimes. It is what it is. I’m working double time to make it up. I have to &#8212; I have four kids,” says Filion, who coaches her 7-year-old daughter’s soccer team on her days off.</p>
<p>She offers the example of a recent takeout order that totaled to $178.</p>
<p>“The customer says, ‘Can you help me put it in the trunk?’ Sure, no problem. And they just drive away, leaving nothing,” says Filion, a Long Island native who moved to Palm Beach County 13 years ago.</p>
<p>She started working as a server after her marriage broke up. In addition to her daily shuffle of mom duties, she was still nursing her youngest child when she got the job. “But you do what you have to do,” she says.</p>
<p>Then again, you might expect the daughter of the late Hall of Fame harness driver Hervé Filion to understand a thing or two about dealing with unpredictable shifts in pacing, in horses in life.</p>
<p>The way she deals with them is to take ownership, she says. For her, working at the pub is not just about completing her shifts, says Filion.</p>
<p>“This is your local, family-owned bar and it’s my home away from home. The people here are like my family. Some of my customers ask me if I live here. I tell them I sleep on top of the pool table,” she says. “People say, ‘Hey, are you the owner?’ I think that’s because I treat it as if it’s my place.”</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DELRAY BEACH, Fla. (WSVN) &#8212; A parade in Palm Beach County served as a special salute for seven veterans who were unable to go on an annual flight to the nation capital due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Palm Beach County Sheriff&#8217;s deputies and fire rescue vehicles took part in a caravan that drove past the veterans&#8217; homes, Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Honor Flight South Florida aimed to ensure some of the nation&#8217;s oldest veterans had an unforgettable reminder of how grateful people are for their service.</p>
<p>The vets were supposed to be passengers on an Honor Flight to Washington, D.C. last year. They would have had the chance to visit memorials that were built in honor of them and their fallen comrades.</p>
<p>But their trip was postponed due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>U.S. Army Lt. Col. Bill Schwartz, a World War II vet, was the parade&#8217;s grand marshal.</p>
<p>&#8220;To see this kind of a welcome, I mean, it&#8217;s overbearing, and it&#8217;s wonderful,&#8221; he said, &#8220;It&#8217;s a little icing on the cake for those who served.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schwartz was part of the first wave on Normandy Beach and one of the few to survive that D-Day battle.</p>
<p>The caravan started in Delray Beach and stopped at the homes of the veterans in the Boca Raton area, where their families and neighbors gathered to join in the celebration.</p>
<p>Honor Flight South Florida plans on a few more honor parades to pay tribute to more veterans who had to have their Honor Flights postponed.</p>
<p>The organization plans to bring back Honor Flights later in 2021, with the first ones scheduled to go out in September.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(CNN) &#8212; Over 166,000 laying hens died on Saturday after a fire broke out at a bird warehouse in Arizona.</p>
<p>Flames engulfed three massive warehouses containing chickens and hens at Hickman&#8217;s Family Farms in Arlington, about 50 miles west of Phoenix, according to the Maricopa County Sheriff&#8217;s Office (MCSO).</p>
<p>The fire broke out when a piece of equipment malfunctioned and caught fire, Hickman&#8217;s Family Farms spokesperson Sharman Hickman told CNN.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just trying to get back to business,&#8221; Hickman said. &#8220;We&#8217;re still mourning the loss of all those chickens and hens.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no indication of foul play, said Sgt. Joaquin Enriquez of the MCSO.</p>
<p>Farm employees reported a fire at one of their bird warehouses around 1 p.m. But by the time first responders arrived at the scene two more warehouses had caught fire.</p>
<p>One adult was transported to a local hospital for smoke inhalation and is in stable condition, Buckeye Valley Fire District spokesperson Sarah Mendoza told CNN.</p>
<p>Hickman&#8217;s Family Farms has been in business for over 70 years, and the farm has been run by the same family for four generations.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(CNN) &#8212; Online platforms directed by Russian intelligence are spreading disinformation about two of the coronavirus vaccines being used in the US, a State Department spokesperson confirmed to CNN on Sunday.</p>
<p>The agency&#8217;s Global Engagement Center identified three Russian outlets &#8212; News Front, New Eastern Outlook and Oriental Review &#8212; that are spreading not only misinformation about the virus, but also regarding &#8220;international organizations, military conflicts, protests; and any divisive issue that they can exploit,&#8221; according to the spokesperson.</p>
<p>&#8220;These sites all vary in their reach, tone, and audience &#8212; but they all are spreading Russian propaganda and disinformation. The State Department&#8217;s finding of a link between these sites and Russian Intelligence is a result of a joint interagency conclusion,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The GEC leads efforts &#8220;to recognize, understand, expose, and counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts aimed at undermining or influencing the policies, security, or stability of the United States, its allies, and partner nations,&#8221; according to its website.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-disinformation-campaign-aims-to-undermine-confidence-in-pfizer-other-covid-19-vaccines-u-s-officials-say-11615129200" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wall Street Journal </a>first reported on the disinformation.</p>
<p>The campaign comes as the US and other countries race to vaccinate people using three vaccines developed in record time by the drug makers Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson. US officials have been working to increase confidence in the drugs in recent months as studies showed a concerning level of vaccine hesitancy among some people, though that has decreased as the rollout has progressed.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Kremlin denied to the Journal that the country&#8217;s intelligence services were spearheading the disinformation campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nonsense. Russian special services have nothing to do with any criticism against vaccines,&#8221; the spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told the newspaper.</p>
<p>The Journal reported that, &#8220;Russian state media and Russian government Twitter accounts have made overt efforts to raise concerns about the cost and safety of the Pfizer vaccine in what experts outside the US government say is an effort to promote the sale of Russia&#8217;s rival Sputnik V vaccine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The emphasis on denigrating Pfizer is likely due to its status as the first vaccine besides Sputnik V to see mass use, resulting in a greater potential threat to Sputnik&#8217;s market dominance,&#8221; a forthcoming report by the Alliance for Securing Democracy says, according to the Journal.</p>
<p>One outlet in the disinformation campaign, News Front, used international reports to play &#8220;up the risk that a person who receives the Pfizer or Moderna Inc. vaccines could contract Bell&#8217;s palsy, in which facial muscles are paralyzed,&#8221; according to the Journal, which noted that while a small number of side effects have been reported by vaccine recipients, the shots are overwhelmingly safe and effective.</p>
<p>Pamela Eisele, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, told the newspaper that so far, &#8220;millions of people have been vaccinated with our vaccine following the endorsement of regulators in multiple countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Moderna didn&#8217;t immediately respond to the Journal&#8217;s request for comment.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A Minneapolis police officer was swiftly fired and charged with murder after bystander video showed him pressing his knee into George Floyd&#8217;s...]]></description>
						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A Minneapolis police officer was swiftly fired and charged with murder after bystander video showed him pressing his knee into George Floyd&#8217;s neck, ignoring the Black man&#8217;s cries that he couldn&#8217;t breathe. But even with that powerful footage, legal experts say the case isn&#8217;t a slam dunk.</p>
<p>Jury selection begins Monday in Derek Chauvin&#8217;s trial, which is expected to come down to two key questions: Did Chauvin&#8217;s actions cause Floyd&#8217;s death, and were his actions reasonable?</p>
<p>“It’s hard not to watch the video and conclude that the prosecutors will not have any trouble with this case,” said Susan Gaertner, the former head prosecutor in neighboring Ramsey County. “But it’s not that simple.”</p>
<p>Floyd was declared dead May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/us-world/prosecutors-officer-was-on-floyds-neck-for-about-9-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for about nine minutes</a>, holding his position even after Floyd went limp as he was handcuffed and lying on his stomach. Floyd’s death sparked sometimes violent protests in Minneapolis and beyond, and led to a nationwide reckoning on race.</p>
<p>Chauvin is charged with second-degree unintentional murder and second-degree manslaughter, and a panel of appeals court judges ruled Friday that the judge must consider reinstating a third-degree murder charge that he dismissed last fall. Three other officers, all of whom also were fired, face trial in August on charges of aiding and abetting the second-degree murder and manslaughter counts.</p>
<p>The second-degree murder charge requires prosecutors to prove Chauvin caused Floyd&#8217;s death while committing or trying to commit a felony — in this case, third-degree assault. The manslaughter charge has a lower bar, requiring proof that Chauvin caused Floyd&#8217;s death through negligence that created an unreasonable risk, and consciously took the chance of causing severe injury or death.</p>
<p>Exactly how Floyd died is shaping up as a major flashpoint of the trial.</p>
<p>Chauvin&#8217;s attorney, Eric Nelson, argues in court documents that Floyd likely died from fentanyl he consumed, or a combination of fentanyl, methamphetamine and underlying health conditions — not as a result of Chauvin&#8217;s knee on his neck.</p>
<p>But Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill wrote last fall that for the second-degree murder charge, prosecutors don&#8217;t have to prove that Chauvin was the sole cause of Floyd&#8217;s death — only that his conduct was a “substantial causal factor.”</p>
<p>Still, defense attorneys who aren&#8217;t connected to the case say all Nelson has to do is raise reasonable doubt in a single juror&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>“Although he had him pinned under his knee and he’s yelling ‘I can’t breathe! I can’t breathe!’ there’s an argument that (Chauvin) wasn’t exerting pressure and his inability to breathe was due to the drugs in his system or something to that effect, or his anxiety,” said F. Clayton Tyler, a prominent local defense attorney.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys say it also may not be easy to establish that Chauvin was committing the felony of assault — as required for the second-degree murder charge in this case. That&#8217;s because Chauvin is authorized to use force as a police officer, and his attorneys will argue that his use of force against Floyd was reasonable.</p>
<p>Gaertner said the defense will face a challenge of trying to move the jury’s focus off of the video and the strong emotion it generates. They&#8217;ll instead try to focus on the medical evidence and Floyd’s underlying conditions while trying to portray the circumstances of the arrest as “justifiable consistent with police norms,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Brandt and Tyler said Chauvin will likely have to take the stand to explain why he felt he had to hold Floyd down for so long. Brandt said he’ll likely say he followed his training, and that it was necessary because his experience with other suspects under the influence of drugs shows that things can suddenly become erratic and dangerous.</p>
<p>Prosecutors, however, have submitted a list of previous instances in which Chauvin used chokeholds or similar restraints on the job. Cahill ruled they can admit only one as evidence: a 2017 arrest in which Chauvin restrained a female by placing his knee on her neck while she was prone on the ground.</p>
<p>Cahill also ruled that prosecutors can tell jurors about a 2015 incident in which Chauvin saw other officers place a suicidal, intoxicated male in a side-recovery position after using a stun gun on him. Cahill said prosecutors can introduce that if they can show Chauvin was present when a medical professional said that the male could have died if officers had prolonged the detention.</p>
<p>Brandt said telling the jury about those events will allow prosecutors to show that Chauvin knew the proper way to restrain someone and provide relief, and that he had done it wrong before.</p>
<p>Brandt said the third-degree murder charge could be easier for prosecutors to prove if it&#8217;s reinstated because they wouldn&#8217;t have to show Chauvin intended to commit assault. Instead, they must prove his actions caused Floyd&#8217;s death, and that they were reckless and without regard for human life.</p>
<p>The second-degree manslaughter count alleges Chauvin took a risk that a reasonable person would have known could cause death. To defend against that, Brandt said, Chauvin could argue that he had used the same hold in the past and didn&#8217;t think it would cause a problem.</p>
<p>However, Brandt said “the whole case” against Chauvin is the video capturing the amount of time he restrained Floyd.</p>
<p>“You hear on the video the passersby, the onlookers saying, ‘Dude, he can’t breathe. Let him up. What are you doing? You are killing him,’” Brandt said. “I mean, it’s almost like they are giving a play-by-play.”</p>
<p>Tyler said if he were a prosecutor, he’d use a still shot of Chauvin’s expressionless face from that video and keep it in view for the jury to see.</p>
<p>“I mean, the look on his face,” Tyler said. “If I was prosecuting this case, I have to say, I’d have that picture up there. You want to show indifference? Just look at him.”</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(AP) &#8212; Authorities promised Sunday to pursue criminal charges after a massive party near the University of Colorado in Boulder devolved into a violent confrontation with police that left three officers injured.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people flooded the streets in an area known as the Hill on Saturday night and when told to leave threw bottles, rocks and other objects at police and firefighters, police said.</p>
<p>At least one car was damaged when the mob flipped it over, and police brought in a SWAT team and used tear gas to break up the crowd that numbered 500 to 800 people at its peak, said Boulder Police Chief Maris Herold.</p>
<p>Images shared by local media showed no social distancing and most without masks despite the coronavirus pandemic. Fireworks were set off in the middle of the street and a law enforcement armored vehicle and a fire truck were damaged, according to police and local media.</p>
<p>At one point Herold said a “tactical decision” was made to withdraw some officers when a group of about 100 people started to rush them. It took more than three hours to disperse the crowd, according to a timeline she provided.</p>
<p>Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty described the rowdy behavior amid the coronavirus pandemic as “shameful.”</p>
<p>“I hear people refer to it as a party. I don&#8217;t regard flipping over a car as a party and I don&#8217;t regard people who throw bottles and rocks at firefighters and police as a party,” he said. “Those are criminal acts and will be treated as such.”</p>
<p>No arrests were made at the scene, police said.</p>
<p>Officers were reviewing officer body camera footage and shared social media videos and photos to identify the individuals involved. They also set up a <a href="https://bouldercopd.evidence.com/axon/citizen/public/hill-disturbance">portal </a>on the city&#8217;s website to allow the public to submit additional video footage or other evidence from the disturbance.</p>
<p>Herold said it was a calculated call not to make any arrests immediately, out of worry that sending in officers would agitate the large crowd. She added that the department had “excellent” video to help it pursue those responsible for the violence.</p>
<p>The three injured officers were recovering, including one who was struck in the hand and another who was hit in the face but was wearing a gas mask, Herold said. City vehicles suffered thousands of dollars in damages and private property also was harmed, she said.</p>
<p>The Hill neighborhood has been known for decades for sometimes raucous parties and there have been previous confrontations that resulted in violence, including 12 officers injured in a 1997 riot near the school.</p>
<p>But city officials said during a Sunday press conference that the stakes from Saturday&#8217;s events are particularly high amid the pandemic, with potentially dire consequences. Health officials advised anyone who participated to quarantine for at least 10 days and to get tested for COVID-19.</p>
<p>CU Boulder students returned to campus for hybrid and in-person learning in mid-February.</p>
<p>University officials apologized to Boulder residents who live near the school and said students who were involved in violence, property damage or failing to disperse would be held accountable.</p>
<p>“If they can&#8217;t meet our expectation, they are not welcome at the university,” said CU Boulder Chief Operating Officer Patrick O&#8217;Rourke. He added that the university knows its students were involved and “We are not going to try to shift the blame.”</p>
<p>After the party broke up, other students came to the scene with garbage bags to pick up the large amounts of trash left behind.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[(CNN) &#8212; Elon Musk&#8217;s net worth plunged last week as tech stocks got hammered and Tesla shares&#8217; stunning rise quickly unraveled. Wall Street is growing increasingly nervous...]]></description>
						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(CNN) &#8212; Elon Musk&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/11/investing/elon-musk-pay-wealth-tesla-stock-options/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">net worth</a> plunged last week as tech stocks got hammered and Tesla shares&#8217; stunning rise quickly unraveled.</p>
<p>Wall Street is growing increasingly nervous about rising bond yields, which could make borrowing more expensive. That could eat into corporate profits, which is why investors have begun to reverse some of the positions they took over the past year in high-growth but risky tech stocks like Tesla.</p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s stock fell 11.5% last week. Musk, who owns nearly 18% of Tesla&#8217;s shares, bore most of the brunt of that massive sell-off.</p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s wealth fell by $27 billion last week, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg&#8217;s Billionaires Index</a>. The decline in his net value is roughly equal to the entire fortune held by Dyson founder James Dyson &#8212; the 52nd richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Musk and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos have been swapping places atop Bloomberg&#8217;s list of richest people in the world since January. But Musk now sits in a distant second place: $157 billion, compared to Bezos&#8217; net worth of $177 billion. Musk remains $21 billion ahead of Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who remains the third-richest person on the planet.</p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s stock gained 743% in 2020, propelling it to No. 5 on the list of most valuable companies on the stock market. After losing 15% this year, Tesla&#8217;s stock has since fallen to No. 7, behind Facebook and Berkshire Hathaway but ahead of JPMorgan Chase.</p>
<p>Even if Tesla&#8217;s stock continues to sink, Musk still stands to become much richer in 2021 and beyond.</p>
<p>He received four grants to buy 8.4 million Tesla shares in 2020. Each of those was worth $5 billion at Friday&#8217;s closing price, although some of that will be shaved off because Musk will have to pay the exercise price. Musk will probably receive three additional options grants this year, each as large and as lucrative as those he received in 2020.</p>
<p>Musk has not exercised any of his options. Executives typically exercise them when they are due to expire, or to free up cash. Musk has never sold Tesla shares.</p>
