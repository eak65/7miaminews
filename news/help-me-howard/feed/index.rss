										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Money might solve some problems, but people with money will also tell you it can create a lot of new ones, and money is why one frustrated South Florida businessman called Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>They say the rich have problems just like you and me.</p>
<p>In Reuben&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>Reuben Ezekiel, businessman: &#8220;I just think this is a waste of time. I spent almost $6,000 in attorney bills already.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reuben owns a jewelry store, a restaurant, and in his spare time, he invests in real estate.</p>
<p>Reuben Ezekiel: &#8220;I actually mentioned to him that the house down the street was for sale seven doors down from me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reuben had called a Realtor friend and said he wanted to buy the house.</p>
<p>Reuben Ezekiel: &#8220;I offered $2 million. He submitted the offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The seller said no. He wanted $2.9 million for the Golden Beach property, so Reuben called his Realtor friend again.</p>
<p>Reuben Ezekiel: &#8220;I told him, &#8216;I&#8217;d like to offer $2.5 million,&#8217; and he said he doesn&#8217;t want to waste his time. Ten people want to buy it at $2.8 million. At that point, the deal was dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reuben says since the Realtor didn&#8217;t want to take his new offer to the seller, and since the two men never agreed to a contract with each other, he called another Realtor.</p>
<p>Reuben Ezekiel: &#8220;Did great, got me a showing, and I ended up buying the house. I paid $2.7 million, plus there is about $100,000 in furniture, so the total price was $2.8 million.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reuben had planned to tear the canal front property down and build another house.</p>
<p>Then, COVID hit, prices soared, and he sold it for a million more than he paid, and then, his money problem appeared.</p>
<p>Reuben Ezekiel: &#8220;I get a lawsuit from Alex Goldstein &#8212; the original Realtor that made the $2 million offer with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reuben didn&#8217;t understand why Goldstein was suing him.</p>
<p>Reuben Ezekiel: &#8220;Because he was out of the deal already. I had no buyer broker agreement with him, and I could move on to another Realtor I want.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, in his lawsuit, Goldstein claims he got the seller to agree to the $2.8 million price and told Reuben.</p>
<p>Goldstein then claims Reuben told him he was no longer interested in the property, and 10 hours later, signed a contract to buy the house.</p>
<p>Reuben Ezekiel: &#8220;He&#8217;s asking for $100,000 in commissions, which he doesn&#8217;t deserve because he didn&#8217;t even negotiate a price for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, both sides have had to hire expensive lawyers. People with money fighting over money.</p>
<p>Reuben Ezekiel: &#8220;It&#8217;s not fair, but I&#8217;m going to end up counter suing him, and he&#8217;s going to end up paying all the attorney fees anyway. He will pay the fees at the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, is the first Realtor entitled to the $100,000 commission, even though the two sides did not have a contract, Howard?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7 News Legal Expert: &#8220;Maybe, but it&#8217;s a tough road to collect for the Realtor. Because there was no exclusive buyer brokerage contract, the Realtor would be out of luck unless if he can prove he found the house, introduced the buyer and seller and then negotiated the deal, but since Reuben says he found the house and another Realtor negotiated the deal, it will be tough for the first Realtor to collect any fee at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>We emailed and called Alex Goldstein, the Realtor who is suing Reuben. We also emailed his attorney. Neither would respond to us.</p>
<p>Reuben Ezekiel: &#8220;That is my personality that if I want something I do go after it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reuben wanted to buy that property and got it, and he thinks in this lawsuit, he will come out the winner also.</p>
<p>Reuben Ezekiel: &#8220;I just think it&#8217;s going to get dismissed.&#8221;</p>
<p>And most civil cases don&#8217;t make it to trial. Usually, people settle because the legal fees add up quickly, but rich people can afford the legal fees, so this may be a case of who blinks first and says, &#8220;Forget it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cash strapped and playing with pennies? Ready to break open the vault? Deposit the problem with us. We have a wealth of information.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>He thought he got a parking ticket from the city, but it was a violation notice from a private company. Can they mail a parking fine to you just like the police or a government agency? Let&#8217;s get the answer from Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>Greg and his family had headed to a trendy new restaurant in Miami.</p>
<p>Greg Santos: &#8220;I&#8217;ve looked it up. It&#8217;s a place that I&#8217;ve been wanting to go to for a while, so it was pretty exciting to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Greg says dinner was great. He was reminded of that a week later.</p>
<p>Greg Santos: &#8220;We got a notice in the mail of a ticket that we had received from parking there, saying that we had to pay $45 by this date.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the parking notice.</p>
<p>Greg Santos: &#8220;It struck me as odd, because it looked as though it was a letter from the city.&#8221;</p>
<p>The letter Greg got said if he didn&#8217;t pay the $45, he could be sent to collections and face further legal action.</p>
<p>Notice the letter looks very similar to a traffic ticket letter from a government agency.</p>
<p>Greg Santos: &#8220;It also had a picture of my car, as if it was a red light camera.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the notice is not from the City of Miami. It&#8217;s from a private parking company whose signs at the parking lot look very similar to the city parking signs on the street just a few feet away.</p>
<p>Greg Santos: &#8220;Oh, definitely, it&#8217;s very clever, yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>One picture of his Jeep came when he entered the parking lot, the other when he exited after eating dinner.</p>
<p>Greg Santos: &#8220;It will monitor what time you leave, and if it&#8217;s more than like 10 minutes or something like that, and you didn&#8217;t pay for parking, you&#8217;re going to get a ticket.&#8221;</p>
<p>Greg tried to contact Professional Parking Management. He says they didn&#8217;t respond, so he went online and discovered a lot of complaints from other people who got the same so-called ticket and paid it.</p>
<p>Greg Santos: &#8220;It looks like it&#8217;s from the city, so you&#8217;re going to pay it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since Greg was convinced the ticket was illegal, he didn&#8217;t pay it &#8212; and got another letter with the same threats of collections and legal action. Now, instead of $45 he was told he owed $100.</p>
<p>Greg Santos: &#8220;I think it&#8217;s very aggravating.&#8221;</p>
<p>But is it legal for a private company to issue so-called parking tickets just like the police or a city or county can do?<br />
Howard?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;No. Some cities allow it, but Miami absolutely does not let a private business send you a citation. They can tow you if park illegally, but not give you a citation. If you get one, do not pay it. Throw it in the garbage.&#8221;</p>
<p>I first talked to the property owner who was not happy with the way the parking company was treating customers coming to his tenants&#8217; businesses.</p>
<p>And the City of Miami was not happy with professional parking management, either.</p>
<p>After I contacted them, a city attorney warned the company it was &#8220;unlawful to issue a notice of violation citation or ticket to any vehicle that parked on the lot&#8221; and it &#8220;must stop immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>After I talked to the parking company&#8217;s attorney, he told me they stopped and were no longer doing business there.</p>
<p>But a lot of people have already paid for the so-called tickets, and those who didn&#8217;t, like Greg, got sent to a collection agency.</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Send the collection agency a letter telling them fine was illegal, and they should stop contacting you. If you have already paid the private company, they should return the money. If they don&#8217;t, an attorney could put together a class-action lawsuit to get the money back for the people who already paid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Greg is happy he didn&#8217;t pay the illegal ticket, and he&#8217;s happiest for the new businesses just opening up.</p>
<p>Greg Santos: &#8220;In a time like this, when a lot of these restaurants are just trying to get foot traffic in the door, you have a business that&#8217;s out here aggravating people and making them not want to go back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hopefully the restaurants will be OK now. Glad we could help straighten this out.</p>
<p>Now, if you get an illegal ticket from a private company, contact your city or county code enforcement and let them know about it. The links to do that with the City of Miami are under this Help Me Howard story.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An unusual homeowner headache: A couple owns half a duplex, the roof on their neighbor&#8217;s side leaks and water pours into their side. What&#8217;s being done about it? Nothing, which is why they called Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>Owning a home can come with hurdles. Owning half a duplex can almost guarantee a headache.</p>
<p>Tiffany Swartz: &#8220;I feel like we&#8217;re on a sinking ship that we just can&#8217;t get off of, honestly.&#8221;</p>
<p>After James and Tiffany bought this side of the duplex back in 2007, they had to replace their part of the roof, and their neighbor needed to replace his side as well.</p>
<p>Tiffany Swartz: &#8220;Any time it rained, his whole floor in the house would flood the whole thing, so&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>But their neighbor wouldn&#8217;t fix his side, and you don&#8217;t have to be a roofer to know what happens if one part of a building leaks.</p>
<p>Tiffany Swartz: &#8220;It&#8217;s starting coming into our side, so it became where we had to start shoveling the water out on our side and, you know, towels and everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>They talked to their neighbor about his problem and how it had become their problem.</p>
<p>James Swartz: &#8220;He just kind of lost interest in everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the fellow passed away, and the bank had control of the property.</p>
<p>Tiffany Swartz: &#8220;They said they weren&#8217;t responsible. They actually told us that whoever the new owners would be would be the responsible ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>But because of COVID, the bank couldn&#8217;t foreclose and sell the house to a new owner, so James and Tiffany have suffered for months.</p>
<p>Tiffany Swartz: &#8220;And so, basically any time it rains a lot, we get water on our side, and we&#8217;ve got mold growing and just a big mess.&#8221;</p>
<p>James Swartz: &#8220;The walls are starting to turn black every time it rains.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bank did put a blue tarp on the neighbor&#8217;s roof, which soon blew apart.</p>
<p>And so water keeps coming into the Swartzs&#8217; side.</p>
<p>Their drywall bubbles, their baseboards rot, and the mold grows.</p>
<p>James Swartz: &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m very angry and very upset.&#8221;</p>
<p>Howard, what can owners like Swartzs do?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Technically, the lender doesn&#8217;t own the property till they foreclose on it, and foreclosures have been pushed back because of COVID, but the lender can fix the roof. If they won&#8217;t, ask the city to push them to do it or go to court and ask a judge to require the lender to fix the roof.&#8221;</p>
<p>We spoke to Cooper City officials, and they told us they are pushing to get this resolved.</p>
<p>The lender&#8217;s attorney has now scheduled a hearing on March 9 to ask the judge to give them permission to repair the roof.</p>
<p>Cooper City will then do their part writing us, &#8220;The city understands the urgency the Swartz&#8217;s face, and our mutual goal is to expedite this resolution on behalf of our residents.&#8221;</p>
<p>And after that, Tiffany and James will have to deal with the damage inside their home.</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;First, file a claim with your insurance company. If they refuse to pay, you have to hire a lawyer to go after the lender, and if you can convince the judge they were negligent by responding too slowly, they might have to pay for your repairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tiffany Swartz: &#8220;There&#8217;s some light at the end of the tunnel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some light as the leaks will hopefully be sealed.</p>
<p>Tiffany Swartz: &#8220;At least if they fix their side, it will give us a chance to fix our side.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Tiffany said a city official told her they will try to help her get a grant to repair her side of the duplex.</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s not just half a duplex that can be a nightmare. Many neighborhoods have run-down houses in foreclosure. Push your city or county officials to help out. If they want, they have a lot of power at their disposal.</p>
<p>A problem splitting you apart? Don&#8217;t want a watered-down quick fix? Come under our roof. &#8216;Cause our patchwork can mold a nice solution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>He started a group on Facebook for ex-QAnon conspiracy theory believers, and it did not go over well. The problem wasn&#8217;t the QAnon believers; it was Facebook, who punished him by taking away 12 years of pictures, and that&#8217;s when he turned to Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>In a stressful, hectic go-go world, James Miller has opted out.</p>
<p>James Miller: &#8220;We get up in the morning, have some coffee, leisurely take our time, go on a bike ride, putz around the yard.&#8221;</p>
<p>The laid-back lifestyle gives James a chance to enjoy hobbies. One of them, Facebook.</p>
<p>James Miller: &#8220;I&#8217;ve been on Facebook since 2009, so almost everything I&#8217;ve ever done since 2009, it&#8217;s on Facebook.&#8221;</p>
<p>James calls himself a liberal, and on Facebook enjoys keeping up with the right-wingers, especially the QAnon conspiracy believers.</p>
<p>James Miller: &#8220;I mean, it&#8217;s a cult. It&#8217;s just a cult, saying that Democrats are Satanists and eat babies. I mean, there&#8217;s nothing more ridiculous that&#8217;s being said anywhere today.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the election, James had an idea: create a QAnon recovery group on Facebook.</p>
<p>James Miller: &#8220;I explained in great detail that this was not a QAnon group; this is for ex-QAnon people, so that they can just get together and talk about their issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>James might have been a little naïve to think right-wing radicals would come to his Facebook page to talk about their disgust with QAnon, but he never got a chance to find out if it would work.</p>
<p>James Miller: &#8220;As soon as the group was created, and as soon as it went live, BLIP, it was gone. The message came up saying, &#8216;Your account has been permanently disabled and there is no review.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s algorithms apparently spotted the words &#8220;QAnon: and thought James was spreading conspiracies, and so not only was the QAnon recovery page gone, so were 12 years of pictures.</p>
<p>James Miller: &#8220;Every single post from 2009, every single picture from 2009, is vapor, vanished, gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his appeal, James tried to explain his QAnon recovery idea was not spreading wild conspiracies. But if you are one of the 1.6 billion Facebook users, you know how useless appeals are.</p>
<p>James Miller: &#8220;They would need 50 million personnel to be able to handle all the, I&#8217;m sure, emails.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, Howard, can Facebook or any social media site shut you down, even though James doesn&#8217;t think he did anything wrong?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;First of all, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, all social media outlets are private companies, and you have to play by their rules. You can say you have a First Amendment right to speak your mind, but whether you are on the left or the right, they can determine what is posted or said on their sites, and if they shut you down, they can take away all of your posts and pictures. Your only solution? Try to get in touch with them through their appeal process.&#8221;</p>
<p>We were able to get in touch with Facebook. They looked into James&#8217; complaint, they told us they made a mistake, and his account was reinstated.</p>
<p>But that only lasted 10 hours.</p>
<p>James Miller: &#8220;They called me a name, and ironically, I used that same word in my response. I got a 30-day suspension.&#8221;</p>
<p>The left-leaning James got into a cussing match with a right-winger, breaking a Facebook rule, but at least his Facebook page and all his pictures will be back — when his 30-day suspension ends.</p>
<p>James Miller: &#8220;It was 12 years of pictures and memories of all kinds, so I&#8217;m very happy to have it back.&#8221;</p>
<p>And since Facebook is a private company and can delete your posts and pictures any time they want, back up your Facebook pictures. Facebook even has a download link to help you do that. Not a bad idea, even if you don&#8217;t push the envelope on the internet.</p>
<p>Facing an extreme problem? Don&#8217;t stay anonymous. Go to the internet and book us. We don&#8217;t use algorithms to make decisions; we rely on common sense.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A silent alarm at his business kept going off late at night when the store was closed. But he didn&#8217;t find out until fines came in for the false alarms. Does he have to pay them? It&#8217;s tonight&#8217;s Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>There are pack and ship stores, and then there are pack and ship stores.</p>
<p>Dan Ford, United Postal Center Plus: &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure one of a kind, but we are one of the very few.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan&#8217;s Fort Lauderdale center cannot only send and receive your mail. They help you do a little shopping.</p>
<p>Dan Ford, United Postal Center Plus: &#8220;Wine, our own handcrafted greeting cards, we got smiling Bob, smoked fish dip. We&#8217;ve got guitars, we&#8217;ve got our own candles with our logo.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe the most fascinating thing, they have Triksie, who can deliver the letters.</p>
<p>Dan Ford, United Postal Center Plus: &#8220;Dog delivery. Thank you kindly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cute dog, and sadly for Dan, his alarm has also gone to the dogs.</p>
<p>Dan Ford, United Postal Center Plus: &#8220;It&#8217;s a silent alarm, which is activated manually here in the store in the event that the horrible happens and someone is holding us up.&#8221;</p>
<p>But for over a year, that silent alarm has been going off, most of them on the 7th of every month around 11:15 at night when the store is closed.</p>
<p>Dan Ford, United Postal Center Plus: &#8220;And, yes, it must be some type of malfunction.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the silent alarm hit, the alarm company would notify the Fort Lauderdale Police Department, and they would come check it out.</p>
<p>But no one told Dan about the problem. He found out through the mail.</p>
<p>Dan Ford, United Postal Center Plus: &#8220;And we were presented a bill by the City of Fort Lauderdale Police Department for just around $1,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fines were for the false alarms. Needless to say, Dan was not happy that he was the last person to find out his alarm was going off.</p>
<p>Dan Ford, United Postal Center Plus: &#8220;You would think my alarm company would give me a call to say, &#8216;Hey your alarm is malfunctioning, we should do something about that.&#8217; They never said a word.&#8221;</p>
<p>The alarm company didn&#8217;t agree with Dan.</p>
<p>Dan Ford, United Postal Center Plus: &#8220;I was really surprised when they turned their back on me, and they just said, &#8216;Not us, not our responsibility.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Now the worst news. Because of COVID, the city is backed up on fines for false alarms, and instead of the $1000 Dan owes, when they catch up, Dan will have a lot more fines.</p>
<p>Dan Ford, United Postal Center Plus: &#8220;It could be $4,000 before it&#8217;s all over. I am not sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he is sure of one thing.</p>
<p>Dan Ford, United Postal Center Plus: &#8220;I don&#8217;t see where we have any responsibility for the bill &#8230; we did nothing wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>If a false alarm goes off over and over, is the city, the alarm company or Dan responsible for all the fines?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;The police could leave a notice when they respond to a false alarm. But in this case, clearly, the city did not follow its own law, which says they must mail a letter to the business owner after the second false alarm. If they don&#8217;t do that, they cannot fine you after the second false alarm.&#8221;</p>
<p>The latest news on the fines: Dan&#8217;s bill for the false alarms was now up to $2,660.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s been resolved.</p>
<p>After we spoke to Fort Lauderdale&#8217;s city manager, he wrote Dan, &#8220;We responded to each silent alarm but don&#8217;t know if police left a notice or if you have been made aware of the alarm responses. As a result, because they were silent alarms, I will approve waiving of the accrued fees.&#8221;</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;It&#8217;s good that the city did this, and it&#8217;s a reminder during the pandemic, businesses are dying, and the city needs to be helping them, not slapping them with illegal fines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan Ford, United Postal Center Plus: &#8220;We are thrilled with the city, thanks to the city manager.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thrilled after his alarming problem was silenced with a call to Help Me Howard.</p>
<p>Dan Ford, United Postal Center Plus: &#8220;We knew we would have a great outcome. We have been watching this show for years, and we are absolutely delighted we called Help Me Howard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glad we could help and the city took care of those fines.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why the alarm company isn&#8217;t to blame for the false alarms. Because nobody told them it was happening, so they can plead ignorance as well.</p>
<p>Alarmed at a problem that&#8217;s left your ears ringing? Don&#8217;t remain silent. Pack it up, ship it to us, and let us deliver a solution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People get slapped with violations and fines all the time in condo associations, but this is one Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser had never heard before: a condo owner got cited because she walked across the grass. Is that legal? Let&#8217;s see.</p>
<p>Find Gloria in her Century Village condo, and you will find a happy woman.</p>
<p>Gloria Bradshaw, cited for walking on grass: &#8220;I love in the inside, as you can tell, the lake. I like in the inside because it&#8217;s peaceful.&#8221;</p>
<p>But when she goes outside, the trouble starts.</p>
<p>Gloria Bradshaw: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think they want me here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gloria says she has had problems in the 12 years she has lived here, but the latest episode was too much for her.</p>
<p>Patrick Fraser: &#8220;You got a letter in December that said what?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gloria Bradshaw: &#8220;Somebody told them that they saw me walking on the landscape to get to my car.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right. The letter from the management company said, &#8220;It was reported to our office&#8221; that Gloria was &#8220;walking through the landscape to get to your vehicle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gloria Bradshaw: &#8220;It&#8217;s crazy. It&#8217;s really crazy, so I know they&#8217;re nitpicking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gloria said this is what she was accused of doing: walking this way along the asphalt, across this small strip of grass, and stepping through the rocks to get to the sidewalk.</p>
<p>Gloria Bradshaw: &#8220;You see no sign saying it, &#8216;do not walk on landscape.'&#8221;</p>
<p>That was in December. In January, she got another letter. The management office would not tell Gloria who reported that she took the shortcut again, but now she was now facing a fine of a $100 a day, up to $1,000, even though Gloria says all her elderly neighbors take shortcuts.</p>
<p>Gloria Bradshaw: &#8220;You have to realize people have been walking on this landscape since I moved here and before I moved here, and you&#8217;re just making a big deal because I did it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gloria didn&#8217;t want to get anyone else in trouble, but she has a lot of pictures of people doing the same thing she did, and has even talked to a couple of them about it.</p>
<p>Gloria Bradshaw: &#8220;I said, &#8216;Have you ever received a letter for walking on the landscape?&#8217; They looked at me like you did. &#8216;What? That&#8217;s crazy. Never.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Gloria thinks being threatened with a $1,000 fine for doing this is just absurd.</p>
<p>Gloria Bradshaw: &#8220;If you&#8217;re going to make those rules for me, you&#8217;re going have to make them for everybody in Century Village. If not, then you&#8217;re discriminating against me, and it&#8217;s prejudice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, legally, can you be fined for walking across the grass and rocks to get to your car? Howard?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7News legal expert: &#8220;An association has the right to enact any rules that are reasonable, and they fine you for violating the rule. However, they have to have evidence, like a picture. An anonymous witness is not good enough, and most importantly, the rules must be enforced the same for everyone. Otherwise, it&#8217;s selective enforcement, and you cannot do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>We emailed and called the condo association. They didn&#8217;t respond.</p>
<p>Gloria then went to a grievance hearing. She said they had no pictures or witnesses to prove she walked on the grass and rocks.</p>
<p>She says they then decided to drop the threat of a fine and the violation.</p>
<p>Gloria Bradshaw: &#8220;If you say, &#8216;Don&#8217;t walk on the landscape,&#8217; I&#8217;m not going to walk on the landscape.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gloria is happy the problem is resolved, and now just wants to sit and read her well-worn Bible &#8230; inside her home.</p>
<p>Gloria Bradshaw: &#8220;Because once I close that door, I&#8217;m not a loner, but I&#8217;m comfortable with myself. I can read my Bible, I can pray. I&#8217;m happy with me, to be honest.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you are sending violation notices for stepping on the grass, you must really have everything else on the property in perfect shape. And when is an association&#8217;s violation too petty? That&#8217;s up to the board to decide. If you think a rule is silly, get on the board and get rid of it.</p>
<p>Traveling a rocky road? Wanna take a nice shortcut? Contact us. We won&#8217;t let the grass grow under our feet while we&#8217;re  trying to help you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s a street light in an alley, a light the city pays for since it lights up a couple of backyards, but the power company told a South Florida homeowner they have to pay to have the light kept on. It&#8217;s tonight&#8217;s Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>If you look at the multicolored house and the tropical backyard, you might assume this home is on a Caribbean island.</p>
<p>Loren Rich, homeowner: &#8220;I&#8217;ve got sort of an island theme, I guess you could say, going on. It just feels good.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bright colors and landscaping make Loren smile. A light behind her yard turns that into a frown.</p>
<p>Loren Rich: &#8220;I just thought it was a bulb, and when I called [Florida Power and Light], they said no, that that&#8217;s a private light.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a street light in the alley behind her Hollywood house. No problem for years till that light went dark, and she called FPL to report it.</p>
<p>Loren Rich: &#8220;FPL is trying to tell me that the citizens pay privately for these alley lights, or at least that&#8217;s what they were telling about my light, so I really don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Loren says the light has lit her alley for 16 years, and she never paid for it. Her neighbor that lives a couple of houses away has a street light in the same alley.</p>
<p>Loren Rich: &#8220;She told me, &#8216;I have never gotten billed for that,&#8217; and she&#8217;s been here 47 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since the City of Hollywood pays for the street light in front of her house, she concluded they were responsible for paying for the alley light behind her house, and she called them.</p>
<p>Loren Rich: &#8220;&#8216;You have to pay for this if you want the light to be on in the alley.'&#8221;</p>
<p>To avoid being left in the dark, Loren agreed to pay $11 each month to have the light on, even though she thinks the city should be using her tax money to pay for the light.</p>
<p>Loren Rich: &#8220;When it&#8217;s off, I&#8217;m very dark back here, and the alley is dark. I didn&#8217;t feel safe with the alley light not being on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, Howard, do homeowners have to pay for street lights and alley lights?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7News legal expert: &#8220;It varies. If it&#8217;s a city, county or state road, and they request the light, they pay the bill. That&#8217;s the most common example. But if you live on one of those roads or alleys, and the government won&#8217;t pay for a light, you can request one from FPL. You, then, are responsible for the light bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>It turns out a neighbor whose home also is along the alley has been paying for the light for years. Then he stopped paying the bill.</p>
<p>FPL wrote Loren that it&#8217;s part of FPL&#8217;s Outdoor Lighting Program, where lights are &#8220;installed at a customer&#8217;s request in areas such as alleyways, backyards and parking lots, and are billed to the requesting customer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Loren decided, if the city won&#8217;t pay for the alley light, she&#8217;s not going to pay for the alley light, either.</p>
<p>Loren Rich: &#8220;No, I&#8217;ve decided I am going to cancel this, and I&#8217;m going to get some solar lights in my backyard to light up my backyard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every street light you see is being paid for by a person or a government agency. Why would a city agree to pay for a light on a street but not an alley? Well, streets are for cars and pedestrians. Alleys were created for garbage pickup in the daytime, and government agencies don&#8217;t see the need to pay for that alley light at night.</p>
<p>A problem darkening your life? Ready to shine a light on it? Flip the switch and turn on the Help Me Howard segment to see if we can brighten your day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, she has nurtured the vines that surround her Coconut Grove home. Then, she was stunned to find out the association might remove the ivy from her walls, so she called Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>Lush trees, thick green shrubs and long healthy vines: it&#8217;s what attracts a lot of people to Coconut Grove.</p>
<p>Lori Mohr, wants vines to stay: &#8220;It&#8217;s just an enchanted charming neighborhood. It really is a beautiful place to live.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lori bought her home back in the &#8217;90s in part because of the ivy growing on the walls.</p>
<p>Lori Mohr: &#8220;The ivy was about one or two feet off the ground, and after 26 years, voila, it goes all the way around. It&#8217;s very healthy. It&#8217;s very dense, and I love it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ivy doesn&#8217;t grow by accident. It takes a lot of work.</p>
<p>Lori Mohr: &#8220;You trim any of the ivy that&#8217;s coming outward. You prune it to grow directionally up the wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Lori moved in, all 18 homes in her French Village association had ivy on the walls. Today, just five do, and she fears that number is about to come to zero.</p>
<p>Lori Mohr: &#8220;The board wants to rip off the ivy to look at the stucco to see what&#8217;s wrong with it and then determine if they are going to paint.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the past few months, Lori says the board has discussed a special assessment to pay to remove the ivy, power wash the walls, patch units that have water intrusion, then paint the buildings.</p>
<p>Lori Mohr: &#8220;It&#8217;s just original stucco. It doesn&#8217;t need to be painted. It doesn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s the beauty of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lori hired a lawyer to legally notify the board she didn&#8217;t want her ivy to be touched. No one responded, leaving her to think the worst.</p>
<p>Lori Mohr: &#8220;When they first said of their intention to kill the ivy, I felt like they were trying to kill my dog. This is a living thing that I&#8217;ve cultivated &#8212; 26 years!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lori is so worried her ivy will be ripped down, she hired an artist just in case.</p>
<p>Lori Mohr: &#8220;To capture the memory of my house, and she really is capturing the essence in a Coconut Grove watercolor way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The painting should be beautiful hanging inside her home, but Lori hopes to also keep the ivy clinging outside her home.</p>
<p>Lori Mohr: &#8220;I want them to leave my ivy alone. I want them to leave me and my ivy alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, can Lori keep the vines on the side of her home?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7 News Legal Expert: &#8220;I believe so because this a material alteration, and state law would require 75% of the unit owners to approve removing the ivy unless they have a clause in their documents to just needing a simple majority.&#8221;</p>
<p>I spoke to the property manager. She said seven units have a water intrusion problem that needs to be repaired.</p>
<p>Lori counters that her vine covered walls do not have any water problems.</p>
<p>The property manager then said they were turning it over to their attorney to see if they can draw up an agreement that if Lori has any problems with her walls in the future, she would be financially responsible and not the association.</p>
<p>In that case, Lori could keep her vines.</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;That&#8217;s a brilliant solution. It removes the association&#8217;s financial liability in case of water intrusion, and if Lori wants to keep her vines, she can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lori&#8217;s answer?</p>
<p>Lori Mohr: &#8220;Absolutely, I am willing to sit down and discuss it, but I do want to keep my ivy.&#8221;</p>
<p>And now it appears the ivy can keep living.</p>
<p>Lori Mohr: &#8220;If it hadn&#8217;t been for Patrick Fraser and Help Me Howard, I don&#8217;t know what I would have done. I am so infinitely grateful and thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>
<p>We will keep an eye on this story to see if Lori and the association can agree on the compromise because we see so many associations and residents battling each other.</p>
<p>This shows you can find a way to make both sides happy. Be nice to see more of that in 2021.</p>
<p>Got a problem growing on you? Wanna trim it back? House it with us &#8217;cause we will be happy to climb the wall to help you out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dentists take a big risk to provide care during COVID. Patients are required to take their mask off, but dentists cannot get the vaccine. Is that legal? Plus, can you now be evicted? The answers to these questions and others in tonight&#8217;s Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>Michelle Segal is a dentist. In a way, it&#8217;s a family tradition.</p>
<p>Dr. Michelle Segal: &#8220;I love what I do. My father was a dentist, and I&#8217;ve seen some changes, but not drastic like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to be a doctor to know the drastic changes the coronavirus has unleashed on the medical field.</p>
<p>Dr. Michelle Segal: &#8220;It&#8217;s definitely been a challenging time. From the moment that we greet the patient, we&#8217;re wearing two masks: one is an N95, and then another Level 3 over that. This is something we have to do to protect ourselves, we have to protect our families, and of course, our patients as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>In one respect, COVID has made it even tougher for your dentist than your general physician.</p>
<p>Dr. Michelle Segal: &#8220;In our profession, we actually have to tell you to remove your mask in order for us to perform something for your health.&#8221;</p>
<p>So when Florida announced frontline health care workers would be the first to get the vaccine, Michelle was excited &#8230; till she tried to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Dr. Michelle Segal: &#8220;They said, &#8216;No, I&#8217;m sorry, but dentists aren&#8217;t first. It&#8217;s only the frontline workers that are in the hospital.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Michelle then tried to reason with the county and state, even showing proof she&#8217;s a licensed dentist.</p>
<p>Dr. Michelle Segal: &#8220;I said, &#8216;Well, I&#8217;m a dentist. I mean, I tell patients to take their mask off,&#8217; and they said no.&#8221;</p>
<p>Michelle then discovered dentists in other states were able to get the vaccine just like other healthcare workers, but not in Florida.</p>
<p>Dr. Michelle Segal: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what happened, I don&#8217;t know who, where the ball was dropped, but this needs to be fixed. I&#8217;m very frustrated. I&#8217;m extremely frustrated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, Howard, the governor said frontline health care workers would be some of the first people to get the vaccine. Does a dentist fall into that category?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7News legal expert: &#8220;Yes, they do, and they should get the shot, but the problem is, the state&#8217;s original plan only took care of medical personnel affiliated with hospitals, and that does not include most dentists and their staff.</p>
<p>Does that mean they&#8217;re out of luck?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Hopefully not. In the past few days, the state has set up a website to pre-register to get an appointment for all frontline health care workers, and if you don&#8217;t have a computer, the state and each county has a phone number to make an appointment so those heath care workers and the elderly. The link to both are at WSVN.com under this Help Me Howard story.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope those new sites can deliver the vaccine.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re hearing from a lot of elderly people who got to their vaccine appointment only to find out it was cancelled. Does the agency that cancels it have to reschedule it for them?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;No. If they are kind they can and will do it for you, but legally, they do not have to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Howard, what about the eviction moratorium? Can renters be evicted now?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;No. They cannot be evicted till the end of March if the tenant was affected by the coronavirus and fills out the affidavit to explain that. The form to do that is also at WSVN.com under this Help Me Howard story.&#8221;</p>
<p>Michelle registered at the new state website, and now she waits to be notified when she can get her vaccine. Hopefully, she won&#8217;t have to wait too long.</p>
<p>Dr. Michelle Segal: &#8220;We are in the front lines, and we should be able to have that access to be able to get vaccinated.&#8221;</p>
<p>The vaccine rollout reminds me of the COVID test rollout &#8212; a little on the chaotic side &#8212; but the testing has worked out, and it probably will with the vaccine also.</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;If you have a question for us or a problem you need solved, let us know. 2021 has to be better than 2020, and we want to help make it that way for you also.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the coronavirus hit, many businesses were able to survive thanks to that federal disaster loan program, but now, we are hearing from a business being told they need to start paying back the money. One problem: they never got any, so they called Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>On television, your eyes let you see everything. Unfortunately, for this story, you can&#8217;t smell anything.</p>
<p>Gregory Moody, Smokey Trails BBQ: &#8220;Once you taste it, you&#8217;ll understand. I use wood, and all our meats and spices set for 24 hours at least, and then, you got anywhere from eight to 16 hours smoke on the meat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Greg owns and operates Smokey Trails BBQ at Northwest Seventh Avenue and 103rd Street in Miami-Dade.</p>
<p>Gregory Moody: &#8220;We&#8217;ve risen from the ashes to be ranked by number one in some of the magazine scenes in town last year.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no fancy restaurant, just drive up and pick up. A great recipe for seven years.</p>
<p>Gregory Moody: &#8220;I love doing barbecue. I like making people happy. My meat speaks for itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, of course, COVID turned the heat up on his operation.</p>
<p>Gregory Moody: &#8220;I&#8217;m staying afloat, baby. That&#8217;s all I can do. Just keep paying the bills pay the taxes, and I&#8217;m 100% legal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, when the federal government offered COVID relief last year, he applied for the $10,000 disaster loan.</p>
<p>Gregory Moody: &#8220;I wanted to retain the employees that I had and keep them happily employed.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the government said he didn&#8217;t qualify and denied the loan.</p>
<p>Gregory Moody: &#8220;What can you do? Somebody made the decision, and there&#8217;s nothing I can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gregory kept on cooking, but now, he is smoking after he got another letter from the federal government.</p>
<p>Gregory Moody: &#8220;And they said I got a loan for $20,500, and that my first payment was due 8/2021.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was denied a $10,000 loan for Smokey Trails BBQ, but then, a crook got the government to approve a $20,500 loan for Smokey Trails BBQ.</p>
<p>Gregory Moody: &#8220;How come I didn&#8217;t get a loan, and when they gave away my money to somebody else, who&#8217;s going to make it right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Greg contacted the federal government. They said they would turn it over to the fraud department, but in the meantime, he was told he has to pay back the $20,500 loan the crook got.</p>
<p>Gregory Moody: &#8220;$20,000 is a lot of money to be responsible for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Greg has nailed the recipe for barbecue, but not the recipe to fight the federal government.</p>
<p>Gregory Moody: &#8220;Am I responsible for this loan? Please tell me. Yes? No? Maybe?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, which one, Howard?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7 News Legal Expert: &#8220;Even though it involves cumbersome government bureaucracy, legally, it&#8217;s really simple. Greg didn&#8217;t get the money, and he doesn&#8217;t have to pay it back, and it&#8217;s the government&#8217;s job to find out who stole the money.&#8221;</p>
<p>We contacted the Small Business Administration.</p>
<p>They wrote to Greg, &#8220;Our attorneys &#8230; are referring the case to the Office of Inspector General for investigation. You will not be responsible for paying the debt if you did not submit the application or receive the loan funds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Now that the feds are investigating, Greg also needs to file a report with <a href="https://identitytheft.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identitytheft.gov</a> and notify the credit agencies to make sure the crook doesn&#8217;t use his company name again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gregory Moody: &#8220;At this point, I am taking them at their word that this is a dead issue, as far as me paying that money that was taken.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, it will take the government a while to clear up the crooked loan, but at least after his call to Help Me Howard, Greg feels the job is being well done.</p>
<p>Gregory Moody: &#8220;You can do your best to get a solution, but sometimes, it takes that extra voice. Thank you, Help Me Howard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cutting through the bureaucracy can be tough. Fortunately, we have found a way or two to do it, and of course, we will be happy to do it for you.</p>
<p>Got burned by a rare problem that&#8217;s left you smoking? Wanna turn the temperature down on the headache? Flip over to us and let us chew on it awhile.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 10-year-old boy had a seizure in school, and his mask came off. The result? He was kicked out of school for violating the mandatory mask policy. Don&#8217;t believe it? Neither did his parents, so they called Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser to try to get help.</p>
<p>Justin is an amazing kid.</p>
<p>Justin Floyd: &#8220;I&#8217;m a brave, giant, smart little boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Justin has to be brave, because other kids think he is different and target him.</p>
<p>Justin Floyd Sr.: &#8220;They took him in the bathroom, and they jumped them, and he hit his head on the toilet.&#8221;</p>
<p>A year after the attack, life got tougher for Justin when he started having seizures.</p>
<p>Justin Floyd Sr.: &#8220;He was 9 years old when he had his first sezure. I can&#8217;t even count how many seizures he has a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>Justin&#8217;s parents try to help him lead a normal life, but the seizures make it difficult.</p>
<p>Justin Floyd Sr.: &#8220;My son wants to do karate. He wants to play football. He wants to do sports, but he can&#8217;t do any of those because of his seizures.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the little guy can do one thing he loves: go to school.</p>
<p>Justin Floyd: &#8220;I like going to school, and I like learning, because if I don&#8217;t learn, I&#8217;ll be grown, I&#8217;ll be a grown man, and I still won&#8217;t have nothing in my head.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, this school year, he had a seizure in his Henry Mack classroom. The elder Justin rushed over.</p>
<p>Justin Floyd Sr. &#8220;The seizure was over. He was sitting in a chair. He gave me the fist bump that he was OK.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, things were not OK. The father was told his son could no longer attend school.</p>
<p>Justin Floyd Sr. &#8220;She just said that my son was at risk of giving the rest of the kids coronavirus, because when he has his seizures, his face mask comes off.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right. Justin was kicked out of school because his face mask came off when he had a seizure. The administration concluded that violated the mandatory mask policy and risked giving other kids in the class COVID.</p>
<p>Ridiculous, his father says.</p>
<p>Justin Floyd Sr. &#8220;They&#8217;re using the coronavirus as an excuse. They don&#8217;t want to deal with the kids who have needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Justin was heartbroken, because like any 10-year-old, he has big dreams of what he is going to do when he grows up.</p>
<p>Justin Floyd: &#8220;I will be a police officer, because the police helps people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now he needs help, so he can go back to school to be with his friends.</p>
<p>Justin Floyd: &#8220;I really miss you all. One day, my mom will put me back in the school. I really miss you all so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>So adorable, but Howard, can a mandatory mask policy be used to kick a kid out of school because the mask comes off when he has a dangerous seizure?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7News legal expert: &#8220;This is stupid, and you don&#8217;t have to be a lawyer to know this is illegal. The poor child was having a seizure, and his mask came off. Common sense tells you it was not intentional. Legally, if the district doesn&#8217;t let him back in school, a judge will quickly straighten them off and could punish the district financially as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it was straightened out quickly.</p>
<p>Miami-Dade School District&#8217;s chief spokesperson, Daisy Gonzalez-Diego, wrote, &#8220;Employees have been instructed to enforce the use of facial coverings. However, there are exceptions to our safety protocols, including emergency medical situations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she added, &#8220;A thorough review has been conducted that resulted in disciplinary action against a school employee who unfortunately used poor judgment in handling this incident.&#8221;</p>
<p>Justin Floyd Sr.: &#8220;My son went back to school the very next day. That&#8217;s awesome.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s what Justin wanted.</p>
<p>Justin Floyd: &#8220;The first day, When my friends saw me, they all were happy, &#8216;Yay, Justin&#8217;s back!'&#8221;</p>
<p>Justin has faced so many hurdles in life. Finally, a victory for him.</p>
<p>Justin Floyd: &#8220;I was happy. I started dancing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Justin Floyd Sr.: &#8220;Help Me Howard&#8217;s cool, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Justin Floyd: &#8220;Yep, they&#8217;re awesome!&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, if a 10-year-old says we are awesome, I am not gonna argue. Enjoy school, Justin, and keep dreaming about being a police officer, and one day you will be one.</p>
<p>Some nonsense making no sense to you? Ready for some common sense? Let us school them, &#8217;cause we charge no cents, or dollars. We&#8217;re free.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>His business is near a city park with baseball fields and batters who can really slug it. Unfortunately, the long balls keep smashing into his trucks and vans. What can he do to stop it? He pitched his story to Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>There is not a lot to do during COVID, so whacking a few balls is a great release. Fun to hit, fun to watch.</p>
<p>Sam Ayoub, pounded by fly balls: &#8220;I open the garage door of my warehouse. I sit outside, drink my coffee, watch them play. It&#8217;s nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam&#8217;s business is near the Margate Sports Complex facing two baseball diamonds and two batting cages.</p>
<p>Sam Ayoub: &#8220;A lot of times, I think those kids should be in the Major Leagues, honestly.&#8221;</p>
<p>The batters are good, too good.</p>
<p>Sam Ayoub: &#8220;You know, we need to make a stop of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The baseballs come flying onto his property.</p>
<p>A few just make it over the fence, some land on the roof, and then, there are the balls that smash into his parking lot.</p>
<p>Sam Ayoub: &#8220;Those balls come like flying on here. They dented my truck, broke the windows. I have four trucks with broken windows. Now, I have this one. I have two more on the road. My car is dented twice. You see the dent on the car?&#8221;</p>
<p>Every time a window is shattered, it costs Sam about $300 to replace it.</p>
<p>Sam Ayoub: &#8220;Now, it&#8217;s almost everyday. Everyday in the morning, I&#8217;m afraid one of the guys come in and say, &#8216;Hey, we have a broken window again.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Sam doesn&#8217;t blame the people who are hitting the baseballs.</p>
<p>Sam Ayoub: &#8220;It&#8217;s not the kids. The kids are having fun. They should have fun. Like I told you, I love those kids. I love the way they&#8217;re playing and everything, but the city has to be responsible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The city is Margate, and Sam says he has struck out with them.</p>
<p>Sam Ayoub: &#8220;We leave messages. We emailed them. They don&#8217;t respond.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam is not focused on getting the city to pay for the broken windshields, just find a way to block the batters from busting the windows.</p>
<p>Sam Ayoub: &#8220;We need the city to help us to do something about it, so I said, &#8216;You know what? Let me call Help Me Howard. That&#8217;s the best thing to do probably.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, Howard, legally, can Sam do anything about balls flying onto his property?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7 News Legal Expert: &#8220;In this case, yes. While most baseball fields and golf courses are not responsible for the damage an errant ball causes, if the design is negligent, then they are responsible. They then have to change the layout, put in new nets to stop the balls and also pay for the damage the fly balls have caused.&#8221;</p>
<p>We spoke the Margate Assistant City Manager Larry Vignola, and he was great.</p>
<p>He spoke to several batters and determined the balls were coming from the batting cage through holes in the top of the net.</p>
<p>The holes had been created by hard hit balls.</p>
<p>The city repaired the net and added a second net on top of that.</p>
<p>They also said they will pay to replace Sam&#8217;s broken windshields.</p>
<p>Sam Ayoub: &#8220;I am very happy to call Help Me Howard. They came right away and took care of it, really.&#8221;</p>
<p>We got the ball rolling, Sam, but Margate deserves a lot of credit, as well.</p>
<p>Sam Ayoub: &#8220;The City of Margate actually stepped up to the plate. They offered to fix my truck, and they offered to fix the problem, and I thanked them for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stepped up to the plate. Nice line, Sam.</p>
<p>Now, Howard said in this case, the city was responsible, but in other cases they would not be. An example? If it&#8217;s an occasional bad golf shot or a rare 500 foot home run, then the golf course or ballpark is not responsible.</p>
<p>Striking out trying to solve a problem? Ready for us to step up to the plate? Pitch it to us and see if we can slap one over the fence for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now here is an unusual one. Your septic system breaks, but you can&#8217;t repair it because a city water line runs through your yard. Are you stuck with a house with no toilets? Maybe not, if you put in a call to Channel 7&#8217;s Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>When Gigi saw the house, she knew.</p>
<p>Gigi de Rougemont: &#8220;We loved it from the minute we saw it, and we decided that was it for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an older property in Hollywood, so Gigi could see some things that needed fixing. It&#8217;s something she couldn&#8217;t see that&#8217;s stumped her.</p>
<p>Gigi de Rougemont: &#8220;It belongs to the city, yet it runs through my property.&#8221;</p>
<p>A long time ago, probably in the &#8217;60s, Hollywood ran a water line under her property to feed a fire hydrant. There&#8217;s no record they got permission to do it, and now 60 years later it&#8217;s created a problem.</p>
<p>Gigi de Rougemont: &#8220;We have to make the drain field 10 feet away from the pipe, and there&#8217;s no space to put a drain field.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gigi needs a new drain field because the one in her yard has died, making life inside difficult.</p>
<p>Gigi de Rougemont: &#8220;You can&#8217;t flush the toilet too much because it backs up, everything backs up, and we&#8217;re having to drain the septic tank now every other week or so because of that, at quite a costly price.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since they can&#8217;t put a new drain field in with the city&#8217;s rusty steel water pipe in her yard, Gigi called Hollywood to move or remove the pipe.</p>
<p>They had two solutions.</p>
<p>Gigi de Rougemont: &#8220;You can either do it ourselves and pay for the cost, or they&#8217;ll take care of it, but it will take a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gigi can&#8217;t believe it would take the city a year to take care of a problem a plumber could resolve in a day or two.</p>
<p>Gigi de Rougemont: &#8220;That&#8217;s unacceptable.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mess, literally and figuratively.</p>
<p>Gigi de Rougemont: &#8220;They&#8217;re taking their time, and I&#8217;m suffering the consequences in my home. I feel like a hostage. That&#8217;s the right word for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are no documents that show if the pipe was put in legally, and no way to fix a sewage problem because the pipe is there. Howard, what can Gigi do?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Since the city&#8217;s pipe was hidden on the property, and there is no proof the city had permission to put it there, that pipe is trespassing. It&#8217;s what the law calls inverse condemnation, meaning they have destroyed the value of your property by their illegal action. If the city won&#8217;t remove it, you can take them to court, where a judge will force them to do it, or to compensate you for the loss of your house.&#8221;</p>
<p>But can the city wait a year to resolve the problem?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;No. They have a reasonable amount of time, and a house without a septic system is useless, so the city has to find a solution within days, not months.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gigi de Rougemont: &#8220;So, Help Me Howard really came through for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Give the City of Hollywood credit. After we spoke to them, they disconnected the water line on Gigi&#8217;s property that was running to the fire hydrant. They&#8217;ll replace it in a year or so, meaning Gigi can now put in her new drain field.</p>
<p>Gigi de Rougemont: &#8220;And again, thanks to Help Me Howard, we are able to have our home back and function the way it&#8217;s meant to be functioned.&#8221;</p>
<p>We are so lucky to be able to help people. Now, Gigi has the permit and is ready to put in the new drain field. The city will use a different pipe to feed water to the fire hydrant. Why does it take a year to do that? We were told it requires a lot of planning to run a pipe for a fire hydrant.</p>
<p>A stinking mess fouling up your life? Ready to flush it out of your way? Contact us, and see if we can get a solution in the pipeline for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When she enrolled her son in the program, they were excited. When she caught an instructor belittling him, she was fuming. Can she get her money back? And can you be fired if you refuse the COVID-19 vaccine? Plenty of answers in tonight&#8217;s Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>Work is tough. Raising two kids is a challenge.</p>
<p>Now, throw COVID in the mix, learning online and the hurdles become a headache.</p>
<p>Maryam Omidi, could not get money back: &#8220;It was like a big learning curve for everybody, just learning to adjust working from home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, Maryam thought she found a solution. A place where kids would do their virtual classes in a group with someone to help, and after that, have an organized play time.</p>
<p>Maryam Omidi: &#8220;There he could actually jump in the trampoline after school is over, run around a little bit, so that was like really great.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maryam was so impressed, she paid for the whole month for Bradley.</p>
<p>Maryam Omidi: &#8220;I&#8217;m like, &#8216;This is perfect. This is exactly what I want.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the third day after she dropped him off, she says she listened to the school app to make sure her son had connected to his class and heard the camp employee who was supposed to be helping the kids.</p>
<p>Maryam Omidi: &#8220;Belittling him and telling him like, &#8216;Why are you not following the directions? What are you doing?&#8217; She tells my son&#8217;s teacher, &#8216;Isn&#8217;t he supposed to be in the gifted class, and he doesn&#8217;t even know how to use these?&#8217; And just the way she said it and the tone, I just broke down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maryam rushed back to the camp to remove her son from the program. The owner was there.</p>
<p>Maryam Omidi: &#8220;I already paid you a whole month. Please just send me the refund, and he just says, &#8216;OK, OK,&#8217; and I walked away with my son.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was in August. No refund in September or October.</p>
<p>Maryam Omidi: &#8220;And he said, &#8216;I processed it with Square,&#8217; the company that does the credit cards.&#8221;</p>
<p>But November and December rolled around and still no refund, and the owner was tired of Maryam asking for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maryam Omidi: &#8220;&#8216;And you&#8217;re harassing me, and I&#8217;m going to call the police on you, and I&#8217;m blocking your number.'&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think they teach that in customer relations school, but Howard, is Maryam entitled to a refund after she pulled her son out of the camp?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7 News Legal Expert: &#8220;Maryam didn&#8217;t have a written contract,  so she gets her money back, and even if there was a written agreement, implied in every contract is the element of good faith, meaning in this case, it&#8217;s understood that the child will not be verbally abused.&#8221;</p>
<p>We have heard from several people in the medical field who are being told they have to get a vaccine. They don&#8217;t want it and want to know if they can be fired if they don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;It&#8217;s not mandatory that you get the vaccine, and it&#8217;s not mandatory that your employer has to keep you. They can fire you for not getting it with very limited exceptions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, we heard from doctors and nurses who work in private practices and can&#8217;t get the vaccine. Are they entitled to it?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Yes, they should be getting the shot, but the state and counties don&#8217;t have a plan for medical workers under 65 in the private sector to get the vaccine, and they need to fix that for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The $600 stimulus money is going out. A lot of people have received it, but many have not. What should they do?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;If you have not gotten that $600 yet, go to the IRS website to see if your money is on the way. The link to do that is down below, and if the website says payment status #2 is not available, that means you won&#8217;t get a check, and you will have to claim that $600 as a credit on your 2020 tax return.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leave it to Congress to complicate things, and Maryam finally got her money back from the camp. It took a while, but for her, it was worth it to fight for it.</p>
<p>Maryam Omidi: &#8220;For me, $400 is a lot of money. It&#8217;s a lot of money. I have two little children that I have to take care of, and I work hard for my money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glad Maryam got that money. Every little bit helps.</p>
<p>And the beginning of the COVID vaccine rollout reminds Howard of the beginning of the COVID testing &#8212; just chaos. Hopefully, it will get better quickly.</p>
<p>Getting schooled trying to solve a problem? Want to teach them a lesson? Give us a shot and see if we can provide the stimulus for a solution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the vaccine rollout continues to move slowly, many elderly South Floridians say they have been forgotten, but are they legally entitled to the COVID vaccine? They have been asking that question to Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>If you spend five minutes with 95-year-old Georgia Rogers, her personality will have you smiling. Talking about her 29 family members will leave her beaming.</p>
<p>Georgia Rogers: &#8220;Five children, 10 grandchildren, 14 great-grandchildren and three more on the way. I am proud. I&#8217;m proud of my family.&#8221;</p>
<p>A large family that always gathered to celebrate every birthday and holiday &#8230; until you know what.</p>
<p>Georgia Rogers: &#8220;We tried to do that for my 95th, but unfortunately, this virus stopped it all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since the coronavirus hit, the family has been careful to protect Georgia from COVID. No parties, just Zoom gatherings.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s bothered her.</p>
<p>Georgia Rogers: &#8220;My blood pressure was sky-high because I was so upset that we could not all get together.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the vaccine was released, Georgia was excited.</p>
<p>Georgia Rogers: &#8220;I would like to live a lot longer than now, and the vaccine, I feel, should help me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her son and other family members tried to get the vaccine for her.</p>
<p>Georgia Rogers: &#8220;On the computer, which crashes, on the phone, which you cannot get through. It&#8217;s impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you go online to the Florida Department of Health, you can see: all the appointments in Dade and Broward are booked.</p>
<p>Georgia Rogers: &#8220;First of all, the big problem is, they tell you, &#8216;Make a reservation.&#8217; How in Sam Hill are you going to make a reservation?&#8221;</p>
<p>Georgia says it&#8217;s also clear that with the long wait for an appointment, and the long wait in line if you get it, the state doesn&#8217;t have a plan for elderly people like her.</p>
<p>Georgia Rogers: &#8220;We can&#8217;t stand in line for hours, even with a walker. How can you be online for four or five hours?&#8221;</p>
<p>Georgia says the elderly who are independent, living alone, need the state to set up a definite time for an appointment or vaccinate them at home, since they&#8217;ve done it for others already.</p>
<p>Georgia Rogers: &#8220;They took care of the people in assisted living, but they seem to have forgotten about us. We live alone. What are we supposed to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>The most vulnerable, like Georgia, are feeling forgotten, frustrated, while waiting for the State of Florida to help them.</p>
<p>Georgia Rogers: &#8220;It has to be easier for us to get it where it&#8217;s not so stressful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, legally, if you are elderly, does the state have to give you a firm appointment or come to you home to give you a shot? Howard?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7News legal expert: &#8220;Just because you are elderly does not legally entitle you to a special accommodation. However, if your immune system is compromised, if you have a lack of mobility, or you have any disability, then the government has to attempt to get you the vaccine. Meaning, in Georgia&#8217;s case, they must give her a firm appointment or come to her home.&#8221;</p>
<p>We then contacted noted disability rights attorney Matthew Dietz to guide us.</p>
<p>Matthew W. Dietz, Esq., Disability Independence Group: &#8220;When we brought it to Broward&#8217;s attention, they said, &#8216;You know, that something we really need to look at.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthew says it&#8217;s the state, county and the hospitals&#8217; responsibility to accommodate people like Georgia, and he says, in her case, it would be simple for Broward to do, since Miami-Dade already has a plan for people like her.</p>
<p>Matthew W. Dietz: &#8220;Then the accommodation process would be somebody to say, &#8216;Well, Georgia, you can do xyz at this facility, and we&#8217;ll make a time for you.&#8217; For her, it&#8217;s a simple, easy accommodation.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Broward still has not set up a way for people like Georgia to get her vaccine, even though Miami-Dade and Miami Beach are going to homes to give the elderly shots.</p>
<p>Leaving Georgia to just envision what getting a shot would mean to her.</p>
<p>Georgia Rogers: &#8220;The most important thing I will do is kiss and hug my children. That&#8217;s what I miss.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ten months without a hug. Do you ever meet someone and say, &#8220;Wow&#8221;? That&#8217;s Georgia, a wonderful lady.</p>
<p>As for the vaccine, it&#8217;s a matter of life and death that they get it to the most vulnerable elderly people, quickly.</p>
<p>Someone needling you? Wanna take a shot with us? We always have time for an appointment to give you the dose of support you need.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Teenage twins stuck in Fort Lauderdale, and they can&#8217;t return to their family in the Bahamas. Why, and what can be done? It&#8217;s the first Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser of 2021, and it has a successful ending to begin this new year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s quiet, it&#8217;s beautiful, it&#8217;s isolated, and it&#8217;s not far from South Florida.</p>
<p>Edwin Mulford, Pigeoncaybahamas.com: &#8220;Very small. We only have eight cottages, but it&#8217;s on a wonderful piece of very private beachfront on Cat Island in the Bahamas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edwin and Leslie have owned Pigeon Cay Beach Club in the Bahamas for 27 years, running a small resort while raising their twin boys.</p>
<p>Edwin Mulford: &#8220;Our boys grew up here, and now they&#8217;re old enough to help us, and that&#8217;s been a great thing for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys, Griffinn and Elliott Mulford, are U.S. citizens like their parents, and growing up in a beach town has created a life much different than most kids.</p>
<p>Griffinn Mulford: &#8220;Everybody knows each other, yeah, very friendly. Everybody treats you like family over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then last July, as the 18-year-olds&#8217; passports were about to expire, the U.S. Embassy in Nassau closed, so they had to fly to Fort Lauderdale to get them renewed.</p>
<p>Edwin Mulford: &#8220;We tried to get an expedited application, but they wouldn&#8217;t do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the passports expired, the boys were trapped in Fort Lauderdale and couldn&#8217;t get back into the Bahamas to be with their parents.</p>
<p>Griffinn Mulford: &#8220;Yes, we do miss our family a lot. It&#8217;s been tough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edwin and Leslie had to rent a place for the boys to stay. At the same time, COVID stopped people from entering the Bahamas.</p>
<p>Edwin Mulford: &#8220;Our bank account now is zero, so we&#8217;re having to dip into our retirement account.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the business struggles don&#8217;t compare to the pain of not being together.</p>
<p>Leslie Mulford: &#8220;I could cry.&#8221;</p>
<p>They can&#8217;t hug their kids, and they have no idea if or when the U.S. government will issue their passports so they can return home.</p>
<p>Edwin Mulford: &#8220;We need somebody&#8217;s help that can penetrate the system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elliott Mulford: &#8220;It&#8217;s the same response. Every time they say, &#8216;It&#8217;s in progress, it&#8217;s in progress,&#8217; and nothing&#8217;s changing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edwin Mulford: &#8220;We need them home, Patrick.&#8221;</p>
<p>I contacted the State Department and then spoke to staff members at U.S. Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott&#8217;s officers. They all responded to me, and we caught a break.</p>
<p>Griffinn Mulford: &#8220;Then it came the next day, the two passports came the next day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys got the passports they had waited months to receive.</p>
<p>Griffinn Mulford: &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t expecting that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elliott Mulford: &#8220;We should have called you earlier, a little while back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now they&#8217;re back together in the Bahamas, back with their parents.</p>
<p>Leslie Mulford: &#8220;It was great. It was awesome, the whole thing, and then having them back with us was really great.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edwin and Leslie are happy. Their family is together, hoping 2021 returns their lives and resort back to normal.</p>
<p>Edwin Mulford: &#8220;We&#8217;re COVID-free here, so it&#8217;s a very safe environment, and our place is very off the beaten path and very private, with just a gorgeous beach.&#8221;</p>
<p>A nice, quiet vacation on a private beach. Not bad, and it&#8217;s nice that we were able to get a family back together to start 2021 as well.</p>
<p>Now, the key to getting results with the federal government: contact your congressional representative or Sens. Scott or Rubio&#8217;s offices. They have pull, and they were a big help for us.</p>
<p>A problem left you feeling like you&#8217;re alone on an island? Wanna beach the headache? Resort to the best result: contact us for a sunny solution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From a woman facing eviction to another trying to earn the money to travel to donate a kidney to her daughter, 2020 was a rough year for many. Tonight, we&#8217;re getting an update on some of the most memorable stories we covered this year on Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>We met so many incredible people in 2020. Many of them in a tight spot, like Daniel.</p>
<p>Daniel Bellin, needed RV to quarantine: &#8220;They&#8217;re my whole life. I mean, I would do anything for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>When COVID hit, Daniel kept working and put an RV in his front yard to be near his family but to also quarantine from his two fragile daughters.</p>
<p>Daniel Bellin: &#8220;Everything that she gets turns into pneumonia, and the little one, the baby one, has asthma. She has to take a breathing machine three times a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a great way to protect his vulnerable children, but a couple of cold-hearted neighbors didn&#8217;t care about the kids and tried to get Coral Springs to remove the RV.</p>
<p>Daniel Bellin: &#8220;I&#8217;m mad. I&#8217;m upset about it, but at the same time, we&#8217;re scared.&#8221;</p>
<p>Give Coral Springs city officials credit. Legally, they could have forced Daniel to move the RV, but because of the girls&#8217; medical conditions, the city let it stay.</p>
<p>Daniel Bellin: &#8220;We&#8217;re just happy that we made it through together, and nobody got ill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, Daniel doesn&#8217;t have to worry about hateful neighbors, after he bought 10 acres in North Florida and moved his family up there.</p>
<p>Daniel Bellin: &#8220;They love it. They love to be in the country and the woods.&#8221;</p>
<p>COVID had Ardrekra trying not to move.</p>
<p>Ardrekra Latimore: &#8220;Very scared.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the virus hit, Ardrekra lost her security guard job, couldn&#8217;t pay the rent, and her landlord tried to evict her and her five children.</p>
<p>Ardrekra Latimore: &#8220;You&#8217;re just going to kick us out? Where are we gonna go?&#8221;</p>
<p>The state and federal government banned most evictions till Dec. 31, and as that day approaches, Ardrekra doesn&#8217;t have to worry.</p>
<p>Ardrekra Latimore: &#8220;With you guys&#8217; help, I moved. You helped out a lot, lot, lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ardrekra has now moved into a house where she can afford the rent. She doesn&#8217;t have any furniture, but she couldn&#8217;t be happier.</p>
<p>Ardrekra Latimore: &#8220;It&#8217;s quiet, my kids have their own rooms. I&#8217;m happy&#8211; very, very happy. I love it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin wants to be happy &#8230; with a friend.</p>
<p>Martin Weinstock, looking for a friend: &#8220;I feel like a 16-year-old, 16 years old on steroids, and I don&#8217;t know what in God&#8217;s name I&#8217;m doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>A couple of years after Martin&#8217;s wife passed away, he tried a dating service and felt he was taken advantage of.</p>
<p>We helped resolve that, and as our story aired, Martin thought he had found a lady friend.</p>
<p>Martin Weinstock: &#8220;No, it hasn&#8217;t worked out. She treated me like a 5-year-old student.&#8221;</p>
<p>Martin is once again looking, and as 2020 wraps up, he fears his chances of finding a date are fading.</p>
<p>Martin Weinstock:  &#8220;I spent Thanksgiving alone, and it was a miserable day.&#8221;</p>
<p>But just in case you&#8217;re a single lady and available in 2021, Martin has a message.</p>
<p>Martin Weinstock: &#8220;Give me a call.&#8221; (laughs)</p>
<p>Martin wants to cook up his love life. Daniela loves cooking.</p>
<p>Daniela Lagoa, giving daughter a kidney: &#8220;I love sharing the love that I put in the food.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daniela is a chef on yachts and contacted us after a boat owner refused to pay her.</p>
<p>Daniela Lagoa: &#8220;This experience? The worst.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daniela had taken the job to raise the money to go to New Orleans to donate her kidney to her daughter.</p>
<p>Daniela Lagoa: &#8220;I have a 27-year-old daughter who has kidney failure. She&#8217;s in dialysis for two years.&#8221;</p>
<p>After our story aired, an anonymous woman gave her $5,000, and Amicus Medical Group gave Daniella the $3,500 to pay for the transplant trip.</p>
<p>Daniela Lagoa: &#8220;With all we went through this year, it was the most amazing year of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>The surgery was successful. Today, Daniela and her daughter are both back to normal.</p>
<p>Daniela Lagoa: &#8220;I was honored to be able to save her life. We thank Channel 7, Patrick Fraser. Thank you so much, and God bless us all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank you, Daniela. In a year with so many COVID tragedies, it&#8217;s nice to remember good things did happen to some people, and we hopefully will have a lot to look forward to in 2021. If nothing else, at least it won&#8217;t be 2020.</p>
<p>Someone parked a problem with you? Want to evict it? Set a date to meet with us, and let us operate in our way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To say 2020 had unusual problems would probably qualify as a huge understatement. From the crime of coughing in a person&#8217;s face to a restaurant owner getting a warning for taking a break in her own business. Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser got so many one of a kind requests this year.</p>
<p>There will never be another year like 2020, and appropriately, South Floridians had problems they had never faced before.</p>
<p>Sandra Franco: &#8220;Coughed in his face so much so that my father can feel the heat of his breath on him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandra&#8217;s father had gone to the store wearing his mask and staying a few feet away from people until he met a jerk.</p>
<p>Sandra Franco: &#8220;And then decided to come back and do it maliciously for a second time, and my dad was like, &#8216;Listen, what are you doing?&#8217; And then, he laughed in his face.&#8221;</p>
<p>When we talked to Sandra, her father was in quarantine, hoping the clown didn&#8217;t give him the coronavirus, which would have been a crime.</p>
<p>Sandra Franco: &#8220;I was very angry, to be honest with you, that someone would have such a dark soul to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fortunately, Juan didn&#8217;t get COVID, and while legally, the cougher didn&#8217;t have a leg to stand on, COVID left Katia without a chair to sit in.</p>
<p>Katia Roque: &#8220;Can we have this table? Can my employees take their break there? Can the owners sit?&#8221;</p>
<p>When Miami-Dade restaurants were only allowed to seat customers outside, Katia kept a table inside her Munchie&#8217;s Cafe to sit and take a break. Nope, said code enforcement.</p>
<p>Katia Roque: &#8220;She simply said, &#8216;Listen, I&#8217;m doing my job. Don&#8217;t argue with me, and I have to give you the warning.'&#8221;</p>
<p>After we read the county order, we determined the inspector was wrong. Katia and her employees can sit at a table and take a break inside her restaurant.</p>
<p>Sue Chatlos: &#8220;Oh, I love sitting there. It&#8217;s wonderful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sue loved sitting in her backyard looking through a gap in the fence as boats go down the canal until her neighbor blocked her view with his big Trump sign.</p>
<p>Sue Chatlos: &#8220;That property has over 100 feet of waterfront. He could have put it anywhere, but he put it right in front of the chairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sue was told her neighbor put his Trump sign there to get back at her because Sue was a big Joe Biden fan, flying her Dump Trump and Dogs Against Trump signs in her yard.</p>
<p>Sue Chatlos: &#8220;A lot of opinionated people in the area, which is good, for the most part.&#8221;</p>
<p>Legally, her neighbor won. He could put his Trump sign anywhere he wanted, but Sue won the bigger battle when Joe Biden was elected president.</p>
<p>Etta Harbin: &#8220;Right now, I need to know what to do. How do we inform the family? Because we want to be in compliance.&#8221;</p>
<p>When COVID crashed into our lives, Etta Harbin worried about her parishioners&#8217; afterlife because the state and county COVID rules would only allow small gatherings for funerals in her church.</p>
<p>Etta Harbin: &#8220;There are families, immediate family members. What do you say to them? How do you tell them only 10?&#8221;</p>
<p>But then the governments concluded churches were essential and exempt from the rules, so Etta could have large socially distanced funerals.</p>
<p>From praying for souls&#8230;</p>
<p>Ana Karina Cespedes: &#8220;I finally got approved. They approved me for $24,200.&#8221;</p>
<p>To saving a business, Ana got a federal loan to help her small freelance company survive, but the bank the government used to handle her loan refused to give it to her.</p>
<p>Ana Karina Cespedes: &#8220;I&#8217;m paying back the SBA, so the bank has really nothing to do with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>We heard from several people like Ana who could not get the banks to release the government COVID money.</p>
<p>Legally though, they had to, and after we contacted the bank, they turned the money over to Ana.</p>
<p>Ana Karina Cespedes: &#8220;Thank you so much for everything that you do for us little people to fight the fight. For fighting this fight with me, I am eternally grateful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glad we could help you out, Ana &#8217;cause we try to help as many people as we can, and we all saw so many problems in 2020 we had never seen before and hopefully will never see again, &#8217;cause no-one wants to relive the 2020 headaches.</p>
<p>Got a problem that&#8217;s nothing to sneeze about? Feel like you don&#8217;t have a prayer of solving it? Give us the sign and let us loan you our support.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was such a terrible year because of COVID for so many people. One family couldn&#8217;t find out where their father was. Another wasn&#8217;t allowed to view their dead relative&#8217;s body to confirm it was the right person because he died of the coronavirus. But there was some amazing news for Howard Finkelstein&#8217;s mother. It&#8217;s all in tonight&#8217;s Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>2020 was tough. Not having-to-wear-a-mask or work-from-home tough. Losing-a-loved-one tough.</p>
<p>Rafael Perez, couldn&#8217;t find his father: &#8220;He started saying that he was tired of living, that he wanted to die.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rafael&#8217;s 95-year-old father Alberto was hit with COVID and hospitalized. Fortunately, he recovered, but then he was sent to a nursing home.</p>
<p>Rafael asked, &#8220;&#8216;Which one?&#8217; &#8216;Oh, we don&#8217;t know.&#8217; &#8216;What do you mean you don&#8217;t know? He was transferred.&#8217; &#8216;Oh, we can&#8217;t tell you.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Rafael says the Florida Department of Children and Families told him, since he was a ward of the state, they didn&#8217;t have to tell him where his 95-year-old father was.</p>
<p>Rafael Perez: &#8220;I&#8217;m sure he is scared. I don&#8217;t even know if he is alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rafael asked us to find his father. First we determined the state was wrong. Legally, they had to tell him where his father was.</p>
<p>And they did tell him &#8230; that Alberto had passed away.</p>
<p>Rafael Perez: &#8220;Finally, thanks to you guys digging around, they told me his body was at the morgue.&#8221;</p>
<p>A horrible ending in this terrible year.</p>
<p>Lazaro Chirino, couldn&#8217;t view father&#8217;s body: &#8220;It really makes no sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>COVID also created a nightmare for Francisco Chirino&#8217;s family.</p>
<p>Cindy Sanchez, couldn&#8217;t view grandfather&#8217;s body: &#8220;We were never able to see my grandfather while he was in the hospital because of the COVID situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>COVID killed Francisco &#8230; and then another nightmare appeared.</p>
<p>Cindy Sanchez: &#8220;They need to let me see the body so I can identify my grandfather is in the casket.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funeral home wouldn&#8217;t let the family see Francisco and also refused to embalm him because he died of COVID.</p>
<p>And then&#8230;</p>
<p>Lazaro Sanchez: &#8220;The cemetery is basically telling us they will not place him in the mausoleum if he&#8217;s not embalmed.&#8221;</p>
<p>After we got involved, they then took a picture of Francisco to show Cindy it was her grandfather, and another funeral home embalmed him.</p>
<p>Lazaro Sanchez: &#8220;We do understand the issue of the pandemic and the coronavirus and all of that, but I think it&#8217;s unjust.&#8221;</p>
<p>One more sad coronavirus story we saw over and over.</p>
<p>Clarica Walker, electricity turned off: &#8220;On Friday at 12 noon, the power goes out in my house.&#8221;</p>
<p>When COVID hit, the state blocked Clarica&#8217;s landlord from evicting here, so in retaliation, he cut her power to get her to leave.</p>
<p>Clarica Walker: &#8220;My 9-year-old daughter in there that has chronic asthma, I have to put her on a breathing machine twice a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>What the landlord did was illegal. We let him know, and the electricity was turned back on.</p>
<p>Clarica Walker: &#8220;I don&#8217;t care how many tears roll down my face. Thank you, Help Me Howard and Channel 7News enough, for even stepping up and taking my case when y&#8217;all got millions of cases to deal with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clarica was happy. Howard&#8217;s mother was overjoyed.</p>
<p>Charlotte Rothfarb, Howard Finkelstein&#8217;s mother: &#8220;You have to have that willpower, and this has been my motto all along. &#8216;Yes, I can, and yes, I will.'&#8221;</p>
<p>We met Charlotte through Zoom on her 90th birthday. An enormous day, because 10 years ago, she was hit with Stage 4 cancer and told she didn&#8217;t have long to live.</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7News legal expert: &#8220;It&#8217;s like someone takes a two-by-four and hits you in the stomach and the head at the same time.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Howard started a search to find a doctor to save his mother, and they found Mohammad Jahanzeb.</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;He is a rock star in the world of oncology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chemo was too much for Charlotte to handle, so M.J., as his patients call him, tried a new immunotherapy drug called Opdivo.</p>
<p>Dr. Mohammad Jahanzeb, Florida Precision Oncology: &#8220;You will be my first patient to go on it, and again, in a brave spirit, she said, &#8216;What do I have to lose? Let me try it.'&#8221;</p>
<p>It worked incredibly well.</p>
<p>Charlotte Rothfarb: &#8220;He saved my life. Yes, if it weren&#8217;t for him, I would be gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now at 90, Charlotte is healthy and happy, because when she was told, &#8220;You are going to die,&#8221; she refused to give up.</p>
<p>Charlotte Rothfarb: &#8220;Every morning I wake up, and I say, &#8216;Thank you, God.&#8217; My feet go down on the floor, and I stand up straight. Woo! That&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ten years ago, she was told, &#8220;You don&#8217;t have long to live,&#8221; and in Charlotte&#8217;s December checkup, M.J. told her, her cancer continues to disappear.</p>
<p>Determination and a great attitude can make an enormous difference, not just for Charlotte, but for all of us.</p>
<p>A situation sickening you? Refuse to lose to the problem? Let us prescribe a solution and find a cure to make you feel better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She runs a charity to help the homeless, but then, a bad break meant she might have to shut it all down. It&#8217;s why, in this holiday season, she called Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>We all live our lives, but some people live their lives.</p>
<p>Susan Bain, Starting Over Enterprises: &#8220;I was a Country Western singer. I was in Vegas in &#8217;81, &#8217;82 and &#8217;83.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susan&#8217;s stage name in Las Vegas was Snow White. Then, she moved to South Florida and became known by another name.</p>
<p>Susan Bain: &#8220;And I also was known as the Cougar Lady in Miramar. I had cougars in my house for many, many years.&#8221;</p>
<p>From country and western to cougars, and now, Susan&#8217;s focus is on the homeless.</p>
<p>Susan Bain: &#8220;And we feed, we house, we clothe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susan runs Starting Over Enterprises, not only caring for the homeless but hiring and training them to build cabinets.</p>
<p>Susan Bain: &#8220;It&#8217;s a great trade. They can make from $18 to $35 an hour when they leave. It&#8217;s a great trade.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the profit the charity makes from selling the cabinets pays the rent for six homes to house the homeless.</p>
<p>Susan Bain: &#8220;We also feed 191 families every week. I&#8217;m partners of Feeding South Florida, and we give them meat, groceries, everything &#8212; families, not the homeless, families.&#8221;</p>
<p>A wonderful enterprise with a terrible problem.</p>
<p>Susan Bain: &#8220;So, we put $60,000 down on this property.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the lease on her warehouse expired, Susan found another building, paid the $60,000 deposit and moved her equipment in.</p>
<p>Then&#8230;</p>
<p>Susan Bain: &#8220;I got notice from the city that we cannot have our cabinet shop here, so they denied our occupational license.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oakland Park officials said her cabinet shop was industrial, and this building was zoned for mixed use, so Susan asked her landlord for her $60,000 deposit back.</p>
<p>Susan Bain: &#8220;We can&#8217;t do what he knew we were going to be doing here, and he won&#8217;t give us our money back.&#8221;</p>
<p>The landlord&#8217;s reason for keeping the money?</p>
<p>Susan Bain: &#8220;He says it&#8217;s the city&#8217;s fault, that it&#8217;s not his fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Susan doesn&#8217;t get that money back, she will have to shut her factory down, let her employees go and be unable to pay the rent on the six houses she has for the homeless.</p>
<p>Susan Bain: &#8220;You&#8217;re going to put all our guys out on the street. You&#8217;re going to put a charity that we&#8217;re nonprofit for 42 years out on the street, and he does not care.&#8221;</p>
<p>But we care, so Howard, legally, can the landlord keep the $60,000 deposit.</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7 News Legal Expert: &#8220;No. While a renter should confirm they can legally operate their business at that location, in Susan&#8217;s case, the landlord listed the property as industrial, and it&#8217;s not. Combine that with the city&#8217;s refusal to let her move in, and legally, it means she can cancel the lease and get her money back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Turns out two corporations own the building Susan was leasing.</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t talk to the owner who was refusing to return the money.</p>
<p>Instead, we spoke to the other owner, who has his own non-profit and has a heart.</p>
<p>He released Susan from the lease and returned the $60,000 to her.</p>
<p>Susan Bain: &#8220;I&#8217;m very glad, and I&#8217;m so happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susan has found a new building to lease just in time for Starting Over Enterprises to begin building cabinets in 2021.</p>
<p>Susan Bain: &#8220;Thank you so much, Help Me Howard team. Thank you, and I bless you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Getting $60,000 back for someone. That&#8217;s a good way to wrap up the year, except we still have more Help Me Howards lined up for the rest of 2020.</p>
<p>So, if you need a home for a headache, let us build a solution. We aren&#8217;t craftsmen, but we are happy to donate our time to solve your problem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She had a minor accident and wanted to use a tow service she already pays for, but police told her she had to pay for a company the city wanted her to use. Plus, can you pay to get the COVID vaccine quicker than other people? Those answers and more in tonight&#8217;s Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>If you are going to drive, odds are things will happen, like your car won&#8217;t crank or you will get in a fender bender. Either way, Ileana was prepared.</p>
<p>Ileana Jimenez, Hialeah towing problem: &#8220;Well, we have AAA for instances if we ever get into an accident, so it&#8217;s something that I always tend to have for emergencies.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she had one when her son was in an accident in Hialeah. He was fine, but the car needed to be towed.</p>
<p>Ileana Jimenez: &#8220;Well, I called AAA, and they were already routed out to the scene because he told me where he was at.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the Hialeah Police officer said, &#8220;Nope, you can&#8217;t use the tow company you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ileana Jimenez: &#8220;&#8216;Cancel your call.&#8217; They didn&#8217;t allow me, you know, to have my tow truck there or to push the car over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ileana told the officer thanks, but she wanted to use AAA because it would be free. Then, she found out that&#8217;s not the way it works in Hialeah.</p>
<p>Ileana Jimenez: &#8220;They just said that they just had to follow regulations, and that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re told to do, that they have to use the towing company provided by the city.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the tow truck driver contracted by Hialeah showed up, Ileana asked them to take the car to her house which was two miles away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; the driver said. &#8220;We are taking you to our tow lot and will charge storage fees plus the towing fee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ileana Jimenez: &#8220;$220 for 24 hours, that&#8217;s what I was charged.&#8221;</p>
<p>What would have been a free AAA tow was $220 from the towing company Hialeah chose.</p>
<p>Ileana Jimenez: &#8220;It made me upset, and it made me angry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Can Hialeah force you to use their tow company and block you from using the one you want, Howard?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7 News Legal Expert: &#8220;Most cities have contracts with tow companies to remove a vehicle, but they allow you to call your own tow company if you want. In my opinion, what happened to Ileana in Hialeah was illegal because the officer stopped her from letting AAA come tow her car.&#8221;</p>
<p>Questions about the coronavirus vaccine are now coming in. Can you get on the list to get the vaccine right away?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;No, you cannot move ahead of others to get the vaccine. You cannot pay to get on a list to get the vaccine early. You have to wait. If someone calls you and offers to get you the vaccine for a price, it&#8217;s a scam. One more thing: when you do get the vaccine, you will get a card to confirm you got your shots.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because of COVID, his homeowner&#8217;s association is only having meetings online, and he does not have a computer. He wants to know if it&#8217;s legal since he can&#8217;t watch the meetings.</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Yes, by law, they can do the meeting online, but if you don&#8217;t have a computer, you can call in on your phone to at least hear the meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was exposed to COVID at work, and her boss says she has to quarantine for two weeks and won&#8217;t get paid. Is a business required to pay her?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Yes, in most cases, an employer is required to pay you for up to 10 days if you are required to stay home. If they refuse to pay, file a complaint with the labor department.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ileana Jimenez: &#8220;I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not the only victim out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither the Hialeah mayor, the police or the towing company would talk to us at all, but Ileana says after she went on social media, she discovered she is not alone.</p>
<p>Ileana Jimenez: &#8220;And I got a lot of different responses from people that the same thing has happened to them and with a lot higher fees.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, in some cases, AAA will reimburse the car owner for the towing charge. Ileana is going to try that.</p>
<p>And if the police tell you you cannot use your tow company, explain you have the right to but don&#8217;t resist. You can&#8217;t win when they have the gun and the badge.</p>
<p>Feel like a wreck? Need to haul the problem away? Hook up with us, so you can keep on truckin&#8217;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If an appliance breaks, and you need a repairman to come out to determine what&#8217;s wrong, common sense says you have to pay a fee. But do you legally have to pay that fee? Plus, does a gift card expire? Those questions, and more, in tonight&#8217;s Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>As we all know, the appliances in your home break. Most of us can&#8217;t fix them, which is why people like Daryl Woods stay busy.</p>
<p>Daryl Wood: &#8220;All types of appliances, major appliances. I established my own personal company in 2005.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daryl owns All Bright Repair and recently got a call from a guy telling him he had a broken dryer at his house.</p>
<p>Daryl and his assistant went over.</p>
<p>Daryl Wood: &#8220;I juststart taking the dryer apart like we would on a normal service call, and I made an interpretation of what was wrong and wrote up the invoice.&#8221;</p>
<p>The homeowner said forget it. He didn&#8217;t want to spend that much to repair the dryer. Daryl said OK.</p>
<p>Daryl Wood: &#8220;Well, you still got to pay for diagnostic, for the trip charge and me taking the unit apart to diagnose it. We charge a standard diagnostic fee of $69. That has been our rates since 2005.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fellow&#8217;s response?</p>
<p>Daryl Wood: &#8220;He&#8217;s like, &#8216;Well, you never said this was going to cost me anything.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Daryl said everyone charges a fee to come out, and the $69 charge for a home visit was on his website. Adding, it costs Daryl money to make a trip, so he can&#8217;t do it for free.</p>
<p>Daryl Wood: &#8220;I mean, we have to pay for gas, for our trucks, insurance for our trucks, maintenance. I had a helper with me, so I had to pay their salary.&#8221;</p>
<p>The guy didn&#8217;t care.</p>
<p>Daryl Wood: &#8220;Told me, &#8216;I&#8217;m not going to pay that. I refuse to.&#8217; You got a problem with that? I&#8217;ll see you in court.'&#8221;</p>
<p>A rude homeowner, daring Daryl to sue him over a $69 fee. Not what Daryl expected for a house call.</p>
<p>Daryl Wood: &#8220;It&#8217;s just, his level of arrogance is what got me to reach out to you guys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, if someone comes to your house to check out an appliance, common sense says you have to pay for it. Or do you, Howard?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Yes, you do. Legally, it&#8217;s called a trip charge, or what we call a house call, and Daryl is entitled to that fee. One note: if the repairman or woman has to take it apart, they can also charge a diagnostic fee, but they have to give you an estimate of that cost ahead of time as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is one. Her company got payroll protection money from the feds, and now they are laying her off. Can they do that?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Yes. The CARES Act doesn&#8217;t guarantee employees keep their jobs; it just requires the company to spend the money on some workers&#8217; salaries, and if they do not, they have to return it to the government.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last Christmas, she got a $300 gift card for a salon that had a September expiration date on the card. Of course, with the pandemic, she was afraid to go in, and the salon says, &#8220;We&#8217;re not honoring the card &#8217;cause it expired.&#8221; Can they do that?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;No. Any expiration date is invalid. They got the money, so they have to provide the service. It&#8217;s that simple.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daryl Wood: &#8220;We deserve to be paid for our services.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Daryl might.</p>
<p>Turns out, the man who called him got the house in a divorce from his wife. She said she would pay Daryl if her ex does not. That&#8217;s nice of her, Daryl said, but she shouldn&#8217;t have to pay her ex&#8217;s bills.</p>
<p>Daryl Wood: &#8220;I would rather it come from him. He is the one who called for service, so I would rather it come from him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stiffing a small business owner is not right, and if Daryl did take the guy to court, the homeowner would have to pay Daryl&#8217;s court costs when he wins.</p>
<p>Need a good honest repairman? Daryl is there.</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;And if you have a problem you can&#8217;t get resolved, a legal question you want answered, get in touch with us. We would love to help you out.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The city had to tear up his driveway to replace a sewer line, and when they repaired it, they did not do a good job. Do they, or their contractor, have to restore it to the way it was? Also, what can be done if a restaurant lets an employee keep working when they have COVID-19? The answers to those questions and more in tonight&#8217;s Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to find a truly unusual house in South Florida, but Andrew Wright did.</p>
<p>Andrew Wright, driveway damaged: &#8220;Probably some of the few houses that have basements in South Florida, and it&#8217;s a finished basement. We have a little room down there.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a 1942 Fort Lauderdale classic built with pride and craftsmanship.</p>
<p>Andrew Wright: &#8220;Even the people that did the inspection said &#8216;Whoever did this really, really put it together very well.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Andrew takes great care of the house, the landscaping, even the driveway, and then, the city needed to tear out part of his driveway to put in a new sewer line.</p>
<p>Andrew Wright: &#8220;It&#8217;s great that the pipes are not going to come up and explode in our area of the house. That&#8217;s a positive.&#8221;</p>
<p>And now, for the negative, that once nice driveway&#8230;</p>
<p>Andrew Wright: &#8220;The pavers have just sort of been thrown on top of whatever area they could find.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thrown might not be an exaggeration. There are gaps where the pavers should be tightly together.</p>
<p>Broken pieces were slapped down, and others were not packed down.</p>
<p>Andrew Wright: &#8220;It&#8217;s gonna crack and what do I replace them with? I don&#8217;t have them anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>The estimate to repair the driveway is $8,000, and since Andrew didn&#8217;t create the mess, he asked Fort Lauderdale to take care of it.</p>
<p>Andrew Wright: &#8220;They said &#8216;Oh, we&#8217;re looking into it. We&#8217;ll get back to you,&#8217; and that was probably three to four weeks ago, maybe. I&#8217;ve heard nothing since.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, does the city or their contractor have to restore the driveway to the way it was, Mr. Finkelstein?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7 News Legal Expert: &#8220;Yes, return it to the way it was or better, and even though the contractor made the mistake, it&#8217;s the city&#8217;s job to make sure it&#8217;s done.&#8221;</p>
<p>A viewer says he works at a restaurant where an employee who prepares food in the kitchen has tested positive for COVID, but the boss lets him keep working because he says he feels fine. I assume that&#8217;s not OK.</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;This violates every federal state and local order that I can think of. Contact code enforcement, which can fine the restaurant and, in some cases, have the police arrest the owner, and notify the state division of hotels and restaurants. They can shut the restaurant down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Broward County is requiring kids who are learning online to turn their cameras on, so the teachers can see them. Some parents have told us it&#8217;s their home, and they don&#8217;t want the camera on. Can the school district require it?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Yes, if you want to learn, you have to play by their rules, and if you are worried about your privacy, position the camera so only the student can be seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andrew Wright: &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty well fixed right now. They got it all back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Give Fort Lauderdale credit. After we contacted them, they quickly had Andrew&#8217;s driveway re-done the right way.</p>
<p>Andrew Wright: &#8220;Help Me Howard, thank you very much for coming and taking care of this. I thought I was going to have to come up with a lot of money to fix this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most government employees want to do the right thing. You just have to find the one who has the authority to get it done, and whether it&#8217;s a government agency or a business, over the years, we have figured out how to find those people.</p>
<p>And if you have a problem you can&#8217;t resolve, a question you want answered, get in touch with us. We would love to help you out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the &#8220;believe it or not&#8221; category: workers started tearing the roof off the wrong house. You read correctly. They were at the wrong property, so do they have to repair the damage or replace the entire roof? Find out in tonight&#8217;s Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>Natalie Alonso, roofers tore off wrong roof: &#8220;What is the sum of 4 plus 4 plus 2?&#8221;</p>
<p>Natalie Alonso was teaching her first grade class online from her home. At that moment, her Ring alarm went off.</p>
<p>Natalie Alonso: &#8220;I was expecting painters that day. They were going to come and start working on the house, so I didn&#8217;t think anything of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few minutes later, it started.</p>
<p>Natalie Alonso: &#8220;They were banging, the whole house was shaking. It was just loud.&#8221;</p>
<p>Natalie ran outside and saw workers on her roof.</p>
<p>Natalie Alonso: &#8220;They had taken off 10, 15 feet of my shingles off my roof, and it was just like shock, it was complete shock, because they didn&#8217;t knock, they didn&#8217;t ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company tearing the roof off Natalie&#8217;s house had gotten the wrong address and should have been at her neighbor&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>Natalie Alonso: &#8220;If I wasn&#8217;t home, it would be all gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The damage was done. The company quickly put down new tar paper, replaced the shingles and offered Natalie a warranty. But&#8230;</p>
<p>Natalie Alonso: &#8220;You didn&#8217;t fix the problem. You just put a Band-Aid over the problem, and then, in three years, if it starts to leak, then what?&#8221;</p>
<p>Before the wrong house roofers showed up, Natalie&#8217;s roof was in great shape. This is the &#8220;before&#8221; picture. Now, in the &#8220;after&#8221; picture, you see the new shingles don&#8217;t match and stick out.</p>
<p>Natalie Alonso: &#8220;When I go sell this house, it&#8217;s going to be a patch. They&#8217;re going to think something&#8217;s wrong with the roof.&#8221;</p>
<p>Natalie knows what will happen if she tells a potential buyer, &#8220;No the repair was not from a leak, it&#8217;s from a company who tore the roof off the wrong house.&#8221;</p>
<p>Natalie Alonso: &#8220;Who&#8217;s going to believe that the wrong roofer came to my house and destroyed my roof?&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, Natalie wants the company to replace all the shingles.</p>
<p>Natalie Alonso: &#8220;I just want them to fix it. I understand it&#8217;s a mistake, but that&#8217;s why you&#8217;re a business owner, and you take your wins and your losses. You&#8217;re responsible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, Howard, legally, is Natalie entitled to a new roof or just a repair job?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7News legal expert: &#8220;Legally, the company has to restore the roof to what it looked like before they tore it apart. If the shingles match, they can do a simple repair. If the shingles do not match, they have to replace all the shingles so that it looks like it did before, so in this case, Natalie gets a new roof.&#8221;</p>
<p>I spoke to the owner of the roofing company. He was open and honest. He said his workers followed their GPS and made a mistake. He said, &#8220;We fixed the problem and did a good job,&#8221; but he would not replace all the shingles, which would cost him about $5,000.</p>
<p>Finally, when we had the heavy rain a few weeks ago, there were no leaks.</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Natalie has a few options. She can take the roofer to small claims court to get a new roof. She can also file a complaint with the Construction Industry Licensing Board that licenses roofers, and they can take their license away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Natalie doesn&#8217;t know what her next step will be, but she does have a suggestion for the roofers.</p>
<p>Natalie Alonso: &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s a lesson for them: check the address, knock on the door.&#8221;</p>
<p>What are the odds of someone ripping the roof off the wrong house? But mistakes happen.</p>
<p>Now, the roofer told me he had insurance, but he didn&#8217;t want to file a claim. If Natalie sued him, he might be forced to.</p>
<p>A mistake uncovered a problem for you? Need to patch things up? House the headache with us. We don&#8217;t hang out a shingle with our name, but here is how you can contact us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The coronavirus has certainly made 2020 an unusual year, but as Thanksgiving arrives, many of us still have much to be thankful for. Many in South Florida have gone out of their way to give back to others in this time of need. The Nightteam&#8217;s Patrick Fraser with this special holiday edition of Help Me Howard.</p>
<p>When we caught up with Pastor Smith recently, she was doing what she loves: giving, giving Thanksgiving turkeys away.</p>
<p>Pastor Pamela Smith: &#8220;I love giving away. I love making someone happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pamela is a pastor in Overtown caring for people who might not make it to church.</p>
<p>Pamela Smith: &#8220;That&#8217;s how we do. We go up to the homeless. Six feet apart, we preach the gospel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Back in March, when COVID started costing people their jobs, she turned from filling spiritual needs to filling stomachs.</p>
<p>Pamela Smith: &#8220;We are looking to feed about 200 people.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, Pamela worried she would have to get a permit to start feeding that many people. After we spoke to Miami-Dade County, they waived the permit and let her use the Culmer Center in Overtown to give out the food.</p>
<p>Resident: &#8220;It&#8217;s like God is looking out for us every single day, so God is going to help us as we help each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nine months later, COVID is still with us. Nine months later, people still need food, and nine months later, they are thankful people like Pamela.</p>
<p>Pamela Smith: &#8220;We as a church, as a neighbor, are supposed to give out. We are supposed to give a helping hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>COVID also hit Latrell hard.</p>
<p>Latrell Robinson, lost job and his car: &#8220;I told the lady, like, &#8216;We are in the middle of a pandemic right now. How are you going to take my car?'&#8221;</p>
<p>After the virus cost him his job, he couldn&#8217;t make his car payments, and the repo man took his Dodge Charger, leaving him and his two sons without a way to get around.</p>
<p>Tony Pecnik: &#8220;Linda and I, our hearts opened up, and Linda said, &#8216;Oh, my God, Tony. We&#8217;ve got to help him.'&#8221;</p>
<p>After our story aired, 50 people contacted us wanting to help Latrell, including Linda and Tony Pecnik.</p>
<p>Tony Pecnik: &#8220;There are a lot of people hurting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Linda Pecnik: &#8220;So we all have to work together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom and Linda gave Latrell $5,000 to not only get his car back, but to pay off the loan on the Charger.</p>
<p>Latrell Robinson: &#8220;I was, like, overwhelmed and happy at the same time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their generosity was amazing.</p>
<p>Ileana Abreu: &#8220;You guys are unbelievable. Yes, of course, I am happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>We were contacted about Ileana, who has several medical problems, can barely walk and is nearly blind. She also has to sleep with her head and legs elevated.</p>
<p>Ileana Abreu, desperate for a bed: &#8220;I would love to have one of those beds that you can put the head up and the feet up.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, Ileana didn&#8217;t have the money for that, and for the past five years has slept in a recliner chair. We spoke to City Furniture about her.</p>
<p>Caitlin Maribona, City Furniture: &#8220;For someone who has been battling so many health issues like our friend Ileana, this will hopefully make a huge impact in her quality of life.&#8221;</p>
<p>City Furniture not only gave Ileana the adjustable base and mattress, they gave her an entire bedroom set. Talk about thankful.</p>
<p>Ileana Abreu: &#8220;I thank City Furniture for what they did for me. I thank you guys from Channel 7. Oh, my God, it&#8217;s fantastic! I feel like I am on a cloud!&#8221;</p>
<p>So happy because of such generosity.</p>
<p>Manuel Lebron, looking for food: &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve been hungry for about two days.&#8221;</p>
<p>And we began with food, so let&#8217;s finish with people struggling to find food.</p>
<p>Manuel Lebron: &#8220;I don&#8217;t have food now because I don&#8217;t have money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Manuel had called Help Me Howard. I can&#8217;t tell you how strange it is to hear someone in America say &#8220;I am hungry and don&#8217;t have anything to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>I went to the store and bought enough food to feed Manuel and his wife for a few weeks.</p>
<p>Patrick Fraser: &#8220;Chicken.&#8221;</p>
<p>Manuel Lebron: &#8220;OK, Patrick, wow, this is awesome. God bless your heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patrick Fraser: &#8220;Sausage, there is some pork chops.&#8221;</p>
<p>We took care of Manuel, but we had no idea it would have an even greater impact.</p>
<p>The owner of Channel 7, Ed Ansin, was watching our story. He decided to help many more South Floridians struggling from the coronavirus and gave $50,000 to Feeding South Florida, allowing them to feed thousands of Manuels.</p>
<p>That was in April. Sadly, in July, Mr. Ansin passed away.</p>
<p>He won&#8217;t be with us this Thanksgiving, but it&#8217;s a reminder to not only be thankful for what we have, but for the people we are blessed to know.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The pandemic is crushing small businesses, and tonight, one Coral Gables shop owner says the city is making it impossible to survive with fines and citations. It&#8217;s tonight&#8217;s Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>Elena is a hard-working entrepreneur. COVID has crushed her.</p>
<p>Elena Linares, Razzle Dazzle Barbershop: &#8220;This is not business as usual. Businesses are hemorrhaging.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before COVID, Elena had six Razzle Dazzle barbershops.</p>
<p>Elena Linares: &#8220;What we do here is we offer the old-fashioned hot lather shaves, and we specialize in hair-cutting.&#8221;</p>
<p>After COVID, Elena was left with just her Brickell shop and moved the other one to a different location in Coral Gables, where customers are hard to come by.</p>
<p>Elena Linares: &#8220;Look at Miracle Mile. It&#8217;s a ghost town. So many businesses have closed. I&#8217;m determined not to end up closing my shop.&#8221;</p>
<p>To attract business, Elena decorated the outside with pictures and plants. It started to work, as people noticed. Unfortunately, so did the city.</p>
<p>Elena Linares: &#8220;I got a warning: &#8216;You got to take everything off because you&#8217;re trying to get attention.&#8217; I am trying to get attention &#8217;cause that&#8217;s what I need.&#8221;</p>
<p>With so many people struggling, Elena was surprised Coral Gables was coming after a shop trying to get going.</p>
<p>Elena Linares: &#8220;It&#8217;s common sense. Guidelines need to be flexible, especially now during this COVID crisis that we&#8217;re facing.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Elena noticed the city was being flexible with restaurants, allowing tables on the sidewalks to attract customers.</p>
<p>Elena Linares: &#8220;They&#8217;re allowed umbrellas, decorative plants, massive banners. What&#8217;s wrong with a couple of pictures on my wall?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elena asked for the same break for her shop to temporarily put the pictures up until business picked up. The response?</p>
<p>Elena Linares: &#8220;They come in, and they put that on the window.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fines and more fines.</p>
<p>Elena Linares: &#8220;I&#8217;ve gotten five fines, totaling $2,100.&#8221;</p>
<p>A total of $2,100 in fines for pictures on a wall. It&#8217;ll take a lot of haircuts to pay for that.</p>
<p>Elena Linares: &#8220;I need a break from the city. They need to back off and stop giving me fines.&#8221;</p>
<p>We are in a pandemic. Businesses are dying. Howard, are government agencies required to help them survive?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7 News Legal Expert: &#8220;Yes, they should, and yes, they can, but no, they do not have to help them out. In this case, the problem was the pictures were screwed to the wall, making them, what the law calls permanent as opposed to a temporary sign, like a banner, that can be put up and taken down easily. The city officials should have explained that to Elena how to do it to avoid fines.&#8221;</p>
<p>By the time we got involved, Elena had been fined seven times totaling $3,100. Her appeal to Mayor Raul Valdes-Fauli brought this reply: &#8220;We would be happy to help in any way we can, but your posters, displays outside of your shop cheapen our Miracle Mile and make it look like a Middle East cheap bazaar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elena then removed all the permanent signs.</p>
<p>We got in touch with the city attorney, who reviewed the case and wrote to us. The fines had been reduced to the original $200 amount because Elena had come into compliance, and this &#8220;business owner has not had violations of the code in many years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;It&#8217;s good the city attorney took care of this, but the bigger picture: city officials have to realize they need businesses to succeed. They are a large source of the revenue that pays government officials&#8217; salaries, so give people a break until we recover from this pandemic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elena Linares: &#8220;Thanks to Help Me Howard, the fines were dramatically reduced.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the fines reduced, Elena can turn from battling the city to tackling the pandemic, as she tries to increase business at her Miracle Mile barbershop.</p>
<p>Elena Linares: &#8220;I will forever be grateful. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Channel 7 is my familia. Thank you so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Running a business during COVID — talk about a struggle, and remember, local businesses need you to come in now, so they will be there for you when the pandemic finally ends.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman&#8217;s medical problems, combined with her financial issues, have left her sleeping in a recliner chair for 5 years. She said she could live with it, but a friend said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s turn to Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser to see what can be done,&#8221; and then a remarkable South Florida company stepped in.</p>
<p>If you think you have it rough, pause and listen to Ileana.</p>
<p>Ileana Abreu: &#8220;I&#8217;ve been battling breast cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis.&#8221;</p>
<p>After she lost a breast, her legs gave out. Then her eyes failed.</p>
<p>Ileana Abreu: &#8220;I am legally blind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ileana can&#8217;t sleep in a normal bed now, can&#8217;t afford an adjustable mattress, and so, a neighbor gave her a recliner, where she sits 16 hours a day.</p>
<p>Ileana Abreu: &#8220;I&#8217;ve been sleeping on the recliner since about 2015, something like that. It makes me more comfortable in the sense that I can keep my head up, put my feet up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her life is tough. Talking about it overwhelms her.</p>
<p>Ileana Abreu: &#8220;I never imagined that this was going to be my life, that I wasn&#8217;t going to see, or that I was going to be minus the breast. I wanted to have a family, which I never did.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ileana is too proud to ask for help, but her friend Miriam called Help Me Howard to see if we could find an adjustable bed and mattress.</p>
<p>Ileana Abreu: &#8220;I would love to have one of those beds that you can put the head up and the feet up.&#8221;</p>
<p>As we started to leave, we reminded Ileana we never promise we can help, just that we will do our best, and that was enough for her.</p>
<p>Ileana Abreu: &#8220;I&#8217;m so grateful that you&#8217;re here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some things are just meant to happen. That day, we got an email from City Furniture talking about a new type of bed they were introducing.</p>
<p>Our Help Me Howard producer, Ambar Rodriguez, said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s see if City Furniture has a suggestion for Ileana.&#8221;</p>
<p>They did.</p>
<p>Caitlin Maribona, City Furniture: &#8220;When we heard her story, we just knew that this is something that we needed to be a part of.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not only did City Furniture offer to donate an adjustable bed and mattress to Ileana, they gave her an entire bedroom set.</p>
<p>Caitlin Maribona: &#8220;For someone who has been battling so many health issues like our friend Ileana, this will hopefully make a huge impact in her quality of life.&#8221;</p>
<p>We wanted Ileana to be surprised. We told her we needed to stop by to get a picture of her recliner chair.</p>
<p>Delivery man: &#8220;We are delivering a dresser, a night stand, an adjustable base, a Tempur-Pedic mattress.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ileana Abreu: &#8220;What? Oh, my God!&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s exactly what Ileana needed.</p>
<p>Caitlin Maribona: &#8220;Giving things away to folks who need it is one of the best feelings in the world, and that&#8217;s why City Furniture is so great, because that&#8217;s one of our core beliefs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ileana Abreu: &#8220;You guys are unbelievable. Yes, of course I&#8217;m happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ileana then said something we had not even thought about.</p>
<p>Ileana Abreu: &#8220;I have to learn how to sleep on a bed again all over. I&#8217;m ecstatic. I can&#8217;t even explain &#8212; I can&#8217;t even explain how I feel.&#8221;</p>
<p>When we met her she was in tears. Now she is crying again &#8230; but beautiful tears.</p>
<p>Ileana Abreu: &#8220;I thank City Furniture for what they did for me. I thank you guys from Channel 7 and my friend Miriam, who did this, who made this whole thing happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tonight, Ileana will lay in a bed for the first time in 5 years.</p>
<p>Ileana Abreu: &#8220;Oh, my God, it&#8217;s fantastic. I feel like I&#8217;m in a cloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is that what they mean by cloud nine? Glad we could help you, Ileana.</p>
<p>It turns out City Furniture does a lot of great work for South Floridians. They just raised $75,000 for cancer research. The list goes on and on. Thank you, City Furniture.</p>
<p>Adjusting to a problem that&#8217;s left you sleepless? Cushion the blow by contacting us, so hopefully we can deliver a comfortable solution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People across South Florida are scrambling to dry out their homes and businesses, and it&#8217;s left them to wonder if they&#8217;re responsible, or is someone else? It&#8217;s tonight&#8217;s Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>The streets are flooded, the parking lots are full, the roofs are soaked and, of course, all that water will find a place to go.</p>
<p>Katherine Pilgrim, condo is soaked: &#8220;I&#8217;ve been vacuuming water every 30 minutes while it was raining yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Katherine&#8217;s condo is on the fourth floor. When Eta hit, it felt like it was under water.</p>
<p>Katherine Pilgrim: &#8220;That wet vac in there, that holds, I think, five gallons. We were emptying every hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rain came pouring in her wall Saturday, on Sunday and Monday. Even more infuriating? Katherine and her husband had just bought new furniture.</p>
<p>Katherine Pilgrim: &#8220;I was battling water coming out and ruining the new couches that I just bought and carpet and all the whole living room set.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously, their condo roof has holes, a lot of holes.</p>
<p>Just as obvious, nothing is being done about it.</p>
<p>Katherine Pilgrim: &#8220;The maintenance supervisor told me that there was nothing they could do. You are just going to tell everyone that you&#8217;re just supposed to deal with the flood?&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether you own a condo or rent an apartment, do you have to just deal with this, Howard?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7 News Legal Expert: &#8220;No, the roof is leaking. Put a tarp up there immediately until you can repair or replace that roof. As for all the damage the water causes in your unit, file a claim with your homeowner&#8217;s or renter&#8217;s insurance, and if the association was negligent in maintaining the building, you can go after them, as well. You can also just hire a public adjuster to do it for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the roofs of condos to the front doors of buildings.</p>
<p>Greg Robbins, business flooded: &#8220;We are at a loss. We don&#8217;t know what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Saturday night, as Eta soaked us, Greg checked the security cameras at his business to see water coming in.</p>
<p>Greg Robbins: &#8220;We&#8217;re doing whatever we can within our power to mitigate the onslaught of water.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the infuriating part: a week before Eta hit South Florida, another rain storm flooded Greg&#8217;s parking lot and office. He spent $15,000 to repair that water damage.</p>
<p>Greg Robbins: &#8220;They had a full week to clear the drains out after the first flood last week, and they let an entire week go by without any action.&#8221;</p>
<p>Greg had taken pictures of the storm drains after the first flood. Notice the water sitting there.</p>
<p>Now, look at the same drain as Eta soaked him. The water flows by. The drain is not draining at all.</p>
<p>Greg Robbins: &#8220;Building management says that it is just not their responsibility. What is the responsibility of the management to provide adequate security against stuff like this, so that&#8217;s the real question.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Howard, the real answer?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;If the drain is on private property and management was notified and did nothing, they are financially responsible for the damage the water caused to Greg&#8217;s business. If the drain is the property of the government and they ignore it, then they are responsible for the damage, and if it&#8217;s an architectural or structural problem, the developer could be responsible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regarding Greg&#8217;s problem, the property&#8217;s attorney claimed they had fulfilled all their obligations under the lease and would not comment any further.</p>
<p>As for Katherine&#8217;s problem, the condo president told us 54 units had problems from Tropical Storm Eta. They were going on the roof to try to fix the issue and then would go into condos to assess damage and fix other problems.</p>
<p>Hurry up, Katherine says.</p>
<p>Katherine Pilgrim: &#8220;Because I can&#8217;t even repair anything inside because if it rains again, it&#8217;s just going to all get wet.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s still raining. By the way, if rising water comes into your property and you have flood insurance, file a claim with them, and a reminder if you took pictures or videos, save them because they can help you with your claim.</p>
<p>Trouble raining down on you? Need to soak up some legal knowledge? Pour the problem out to us and see if we can flood you with some decent answers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A hit-and-run victim thought he got a break when the driver&#8217;s tag was left behind, but the owner of the car claimed she didn&#8217;t know who was driving it, didn&#8217;t have insurance and didn&#8217;t think she had to pay for the damage. Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser is on the case.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a 1997 BMW convertible. Nearly a classic and a great car for Mauricio for many years.</p>
<p>Mauricio Pereira, strange hit-and-run: &#8220;Yeah, it was. I always wanted a convertible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s collecting dust after being smashed by a hit-and-run driver.</p>
<p>Mauricio Pereira: &#8220;The car starts revving, and instead of moving forward, she moves back. She hits my car.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mauricio was stopped at a light when the car ahead of him reversed and backed into him and took off.</p>
<p>Mauricio Pereira: &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t believe what was happening. It was incredible.&#8221;</p>
<p>A good Samaritan followed the car, took these pictures of the three women who got out and walked into an apartment complex.</p>
<p>Back at the wreck, a great piece of evidence to show who owned the hit-and-run Mercedes.</p>
<p>Mauricio Pereira: &#8220;When the car pulled back into me and took off, they left the tag. The tag was attached to the front of my light, so I got their tag.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now he knew who owned the car and pictures of who was in it, which, he thought, meant he would get his car repaired &#8212; until FHP spoke to the owner, who said she had rented her car to a friend of a friend.</p>
<p>Mauricio Pereira: &#8220;So, I believe the part that she wasn&#8217;t driving. What I don&#8217;t believe is the part that she doesn&#8217;t know who was driving her car.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mauricio&#8217;s insurance determined it would cost $5,000 to repair the car.</p>
<p>Mauricio Pereira: &#8220;The radiator&#8217;s been hit.&#8221;</p>
<p>But his insurance company said the &#8217;97 convertible was only worth $3,500, so they wanted to total it and give him that money.</p>
<p>Mauricio Pereira: &#8220;And if I wanted to repair it, it would be out of my pocket for $5,000, which I don&#8217;t have at this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the owner of the Mercedes claimed she didn&#8217;t have insurance to repair the old BMW.</p>
<p>Mauricio Pereira: &#8220;And a 2019 Mercedes-Benz worth $70,000, $80,000, $90,000, and you&#8217;re driving around with no insurance? Hard to believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hit-and-runs are so common in South Florida, and Mauricio thought since he could prove who owned the car that smashed into him, he&#8217;d be in decent shape &#8212; but nope.</p>
<p>Well Howard, is Mauricio out of luck?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7 News Legal Expert: &#8220;This is what the law calls the Dangerous Instrumentality Doctrine. If you lend your car to someone, the law makes you responsible if they are negligent and did damage, meaning in this case, Mauricio can sue the owner of the car if she won&#8217;t pay for his damage. If she doesn&#8217;t have insurance, FHP can cite her and suspend her license.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Florida Highway Patrol said Patricia Loquoshia Norris owned the car that backed into Mauricio.</p>
<p>When I spoke to her, she said Mauricio was greedy for wanting her to pay for his repairs.</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;It&#8217;s your car, and you are responsible for the damage.&#8221; She said she wasn&#8217;t driving.</p>
<p>She also said a friend had borrowed her car for another friend and would not tell her who that was.</p>
<p>She told me she had insurance but wouldn&#8217;t file a claim because her rates would go up.</p>
<p>The Florida Highway Patrol said that&#8217;s not true. Norris did not have insurance.</p>
<p>She was cited for that, her license was suspended, and the highway patrol also took her tag, and she won&#8217;t get that one back.</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Mauricio could sue for the $5,000 it will cost to repair his car, but then, he can&#8217;t accept the $3,500 from his insurance company. It might be smart to take that insurance money because they will then sue the car owner to get their $3,500 plus Mauricio&#8217;s deductible, and if she doesn&#8217;t pay them, her license is suspended again. This time, for three years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mauricio is going to accept the $3,500 from his insurance company, say goodbye to his BMW and leave disappointed.</p>
<p>Mauricio Pereira: &#8220;I wanna thank Patrick Fraser and the Help Me Howard team who put a lot of effort into this, but I can really say that justice here certainly was not serving my way. The other person got a hit-and-run, no insurance and she got away with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, FHP said they would have charged the driver, but neither Mauricio nor the good Samaritan who followed them could be sure who it was, and so they got away with a hit-and-run. Not the first in South Florida and won&#8217;t be the last.</p>
<p>Hit with a problem you wanna run from? Stop and crash with us. We have the ticket to insure you get help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She got a red light camera ticket and decided to pay it and not fight it, but instead of the city cashing her payment, they returned it and asked her for more money. Can a city reject your payment? It&#8217;s tonight&#8217;s Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>Remember before COVID? When people had normal lives?</p>
<p>Amy Seidman, paid citation: &#8220;I was having my high school reunion, and I went down there to meet the girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amy was meeting them in Aventura and made a left hand turn into the mall right behind this bus. She would later find out she had run a red light.</p>
<p>Amy Seidman: &#8220;I was surprised to see it in the mail. I knew it was my car. I just wouldn&#8217;t normally run a red light. It&#8217;s not in my nature.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Amy looked at the video, she thought about fighting the $158 ticket.</p>
<p>Amy Seidman: &#8220;And then, I&#8217;m talking to my ex who&#8217;s had a lot of tickets throughout the years. He&#8217;s like, &#8216;It&#8217;s not worth it, just pay it.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Amy went online, and her bank sent the city the check.</p>
<p>Amy Seidman: &#8220;I believe it was a PO Box check made out to the City of Aventura. I did get a confirmation from the bank that it was sent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everything was fine until a couple of weeks later.</p>
<p>Amy Seidman: &#8220;I received a letter from Miami-Dade County saying that my ticket had been unpaid, and now, I had additional fees.&#8221;</p>
<p>You won&#8217;t believe this. The notice that she had not paid the ticket came with the check to pay the ticket attached.</p>
<p>Amy Seidman: &#8220;So, I had my check sent back to me uncashed, along with a notice that I had another $125 added to it for non-payment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, instead of owing $158, Amy was told she owed $277.</p>
<p>Amy Seidman: &#8220;I&#8217;m really unhappy because I knew I had done my due diligence to pay it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amy didn&#8217;t fight paying the first time. Now, she was ready for a fight.</p>
<p>Amy Seidman: &#8220;I think they screwed up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well Howard, you have said government agencies can make a mistake and not pay the consequences. If they did in this case, does Amy have to pay twice for one ticket?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7 News Legal Expert: &#8220;No, while the city does not have to pay for their mistake, they cannot make her pay for a mistake if they made it, so if they did, she doesn&#8217;t have to pay the second fine, just the original red light fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Election Day has passed, but look at what&#8217;s left behind: thousands and thousands of signs on public property. Howard, who is responsible for removing them?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Under state law, the candidate has 30 days to remove the signs, and some cities require it to be done even quicker.&#8221;</p>
<p>And what if they don&#8217;t? What can be done?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;If they don&#8217;t remove it, the city or county can pick the signs up and then bill the candidate, but realistically, they don&#8217;t do that to politicians, and either the nearby residents or government workers are left to take care of the mess.&#8221;</p>
<p>A question about contracts that automatically renew. A viewer said a software company renewed her service and she wasn&#8217;t told. Can a business renew the contract without your approval?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;In Florida, there is a state law that requires the company to give you written notice 30 days before the contract renews, so you have time to cancel. If they don&#8217;t do that, dispute it on your credit card.&#8221;</p>
<p>It turns out Aventura made a mistake.</p>
<p>They had a new mailing address for red light violations, and Amy was given the old mailing address to send in her payment.</p>
<p>Aventura then wiped out the second fine, reduced it to the original $158 that Amy owed, and she paid it again but not with a smile on her face.</p>
<p>Amy Seidman: &#8220;Now, I curse Aventura every time I have to go down there.&#8221;</p>
<p>A lot of cities got rid of those red light cameras, but many in South Florida still have them.</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;And the courts have ruled the red light cameras are legal, so don&#8217;t try to beat the light because it&#8217;s expensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>All red from battling a problem? Wish you knew someone who trafficked in solutions? You do. Drive our way and give us the green light to help you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the government gave most Americans a stimulus check and loaned money to businesses, but believe it or not, some people still don&#8217;t have that loan money. Plus, can you take a selfie with your ballot on Election Day? Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser has the answers.</p>
<p>The federal goverment is still giving small businesses loans to survive the pandemic, and Ana certainly needs it.</p>
<p>Ana Karina Cespedes: &#8220;I really had no idea where I was going to get my next paycheck from.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ana is an independent freelance producer, working on all types of shows.</p>
<p>Ana Karina Cespedes: &#8220;I&#8217;ve done other, you know, cooking shows, soap operas. I&#8217;ve done everything, commercials, music videos. This one was for games of the 31st Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the coronavirus turned the lights out on the production business, and that&#8217;s when Ana turned to the federal loan program.</p>
<p>Ana Karina Cespedes: &#8220;So after a little bit of back and forth with the SBA directly, I finally got approved. They approved me for $24,200. I was so relieved I cried.&#8221;</p>
<p>But after the government deposited the money into her Chase account, she would be crying again &#8212; and not tears of joy.</p>
<p>Ana Karina Cespedes: &#8220;He says, &#8216;You are not a business. You are not entitled to this money. We cannot release this money.'&#8221;</p>
<p>The Chase bank rep said they could only release the money to a business, and since Ana was a self-employed independent contractor, she couldn&#8217;t get the money out of her own account.</p>
<p>Ana Karina Cespedes: &#8220;I&#8217;m paying back the SBA, so the bank has really nothing to do with it. I&#8217;m paying back the Small Business Administration. I&#8217;m not paying back Chase. Chase did not lend me this money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ana argued with the bank, explaining the government did loan money to individuals. Ana lost.</p>
<p>Ana Karina Cespedes: &#8220;I want my money. I&#8217;m entitled to that money. My voice is cracking, but I don&#8217;t want to lose hope, you know, which is why I reached out to you guys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, Howard, who is right, Ana and the federal government or the bank?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;The bank is wrong. Some employees didn&#8217;t read the federal law and didn&#8217;t listen to Ana when she tried to explain it to them. If they won&#8217;t release the money, ask the Small Business Administration to take the money back and issue it through another bank, then file a complaint with the federal OCC department.&#8221;</p>
<p>Election Day is finally here. Two quick questions, Howard. As you vote, can you take a selfie of you and your ballot?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Yes, you can. A recent change in Florida law allows you to take a picture of your ballot with you holding it. But there is a law that says you cannot show it to someone else, so if you post it, it could be a crime. But don&#8217;t worry, I am not aware of anyone ever being charged for posting their ballot online.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many people have concealed weapons permits. Can they take their gun into the voting precinct?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;No. A permit to carry and conceal prohibits you from carrying it into some places, like a school, a courthouse, police station and a voting precinct, so if you have a concealed weapon, leave it at home or your car because if you get caught with it in a polling place, it&#8217;s a crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ana Karina Cespedes: &#8220;Dear Help Me Howard team, we did it!&#8221;</p>
<p>We contacted Chase. They said due to privacy reasons, they could not discuss Ana&#8217;s account, and then they did what we asked and released the $24,600 to her.</p>
<p>Ana Karina Cespedes: &#8220;Thank you so much for everything that you do and for us little people to fight the fight. For fighting the fight with me, I am eternally grateful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glad we could help you, Ana, and good luck getting back to work.</p>
<p>We have heard from a lot of small business owners or freelancers like Ana who can&#8217;t get their bank to release the money. If that&#8217;s you, file that complaint with the OCC.</p>
<p>Do you have a problem you can&#8217;t solve? A legal question you need answered? Please get in touch with us. We would love to help you out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Odds are your neighborhood has yards with political signs, but one South Florida woman put up her signs and then started getting fined, so to straighten things out, she turned to Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>Many people can&#8217;t wait for Election Day and the political season to end. Linda, on the other hand, enjoys it.</p>
<p>Linda Schainberg: &#8220;Campaigning, yeah, I love it.&#8221;</p>
<p>One look at Linda&#8217;s yard and it&#8217;s clear she is passionate about politics.</p>
<p>Linda Schainberg: &#8220;I had signs for a judge. I had signs for congressional candidates, and I always had a Trump sign from day one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, according to Pembroke Pines records, a neighbor complained about the 14 signs Linda had in her yard, and that brought a visit from code enforcement.</p>
<p>Linda Schainberg: &#8220;I got a violation. They brought it, put it on my door. Then, it said I had seven days to comply.&#8221;</p>
<p>To avoid the $250 fine, Linda Googled the city ordinance that said she could have one sign per candidate.</p>
<p>Linda Schainberg: &#8220;And what did I do? I removed all the other signs and had only one sign per candidate per side of the street.&#8221;</p>
<p>But instead of ending her trouble, it escalated.</p>
<p>Linda Schainberg: &#8220;That was Friday. A police officer came out with code enforcement, and I said, &#8216;Do we really need a police officer?'&#8221;</p>
<p>Linda was now told she was going to be fined $500 a day for her political signs. She loves politics and her politicians, but her wallet has a limit.</p>
<p>Linda Schainberg: &#8220;I&#8217;m willing to do the $250, but, you know now, you&#8217;re looking at $750 and then $500 every day. I can&#8217;t afford that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Linda took all her political signs down, stunned as she put them away.</p>
<p>Linda Schainberg: &#8220;And I&#8217;m exercising my First Amendment, God-given right. I live in the United States of America. Why can&#8217;t I have political signs during a political election?&#8221;</p>
<p>Linda found the ordinance online that says she can have one sign for each candidate or can she, Howard?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7 News Legal Expert: &#8220;No, and it&#8217;s not her fault. The ordinance Linda found on the internet is an old one that didn&#8217;t get taken down. The new Pembroke Pines ordinance is stricter and limits the size and number of signs, so if it&#8217;s the average yard sign, you will be limited to about two signs.&#8221;</p>
<p>We have seen so much flooding in neighborhoods in the past few days. In general, who is responsible for the damage the flood causes?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;In most cases, the government is not responsible for flood damage. If it&#8217;s a construction defect, you might be able to go after the builder, and remember, homeowner&#8217;s insurance doesn&#8217;t cover the damage, but flood insurance should, if you have it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A viewer has a lien on her tag from 15 years ago. Do liens expire?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Yes, they expire after five years, so she needs to ask the DMV to remove the lien since she no longer has to pay it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Linda Schainberg: &#8220;I&#8217;m pretty upset.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pembroke Pines told us they felt Linda was hostile and aggressive when code enforcement came out, and that&#8217;s why they took a police officer with them.</p>
<p>They added Linda at one point had 80 signs in her yard.</p>
<p>Linda said she seriously doubts that, but to avoid trouble, she took all her political signs down, and the city then wiped out the fines.</p>
<p>Linda Schainberg: &#8220;I&#8217;m at a loss because I still feel that they&#8217;re suppressing me, that they&#8217;re violating my Constitutional rights. I truly believe this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;And Linda may one day be able to put as many political signs as she wants. That&#8217;s because the city&#8217;s ordinance limiting signs comes from a 2015 Supreme Court ruling that, I think, the city will be forced to rewrite the ordinance again because it limits a person to showing support for two candidates when they have a right to support as many as they want on their property.&#8221;</p>
<p>Got a problem that&#8217;s a sign of the times? Tired of being the underdog? Fill in our name and become a candidate for us to help, so we can turn you into the front runner.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>He walked into a Broward precinct during early voting to cast his ballot and then was told, &#8220;You already voted today.&#8221; Of course, he had not and was not happy his right to vote was being taken from him, which is why he put in  a call to Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>The right to vote is what separates a democracy from a dictatorship.</p>
<p>Matthew Bryant: &#8220;I&#8217;ve never missed an election. It&#8217;s fundamental to what it means to be an American.&#8221;</p>
<p>And last week, Matthew and his wife got in line for early voting, ready to cast their ballots in person.</p>
<p>Matthew Bryant: &#8220;My wife and I both felt that voting in person was the best way to ensure that our vote was truly actually counted.&#8221;</p>
<p>But when Matthew&#8217;s turn came at the Broward precinct, they scanned his driver&#8217;s license and told him, &#8220;You already voted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthew Bryant: &#8220;&#8216;This can&#8217;t be right. I know I didn&#8217;t vote yet. What are you talking about?'&#8221;</p>
<p>A supervisor came over to confirm that the records showed Matthew had indeed cast his ballot that morning.</p>
<p>Matthew Bryant: &#8220;They verified then that Matthew Bryant at 6800 address had, in fact, voted already.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthew was stunned, since state law requires the voter to have a valid ID.</p>
<p>Matthew Bryant: &#8220;Apparently, the person that morning must not have had a photo ID. My first question to them is who took away my right to vote?&#8221;</p>
<p>A vote Matthew was excited to cast for his candidate.</p>
<p>Matthew Bryant: &#8220;I voted for Trump.&#8221;</p>
<p>But now Matthew fears he lost his right to cast that ballot.</p>
<p>Matthew Bryant: &#8220;Certainly I am personally offended. This is my right. I&#8217;m an American citizen, I paid my taxes, you know. I&#8217;m a productive member of our society. I need to have a say.&#8221;</p>
<p>And if you cannot vote, you don&#8217;t have a say, so legally, Howard, what should Matthew do to get that other ballot tossed and his counted?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;First, Matthew should request what&#8217;s called a provisional ballot, which is a regular ballot he fills out that is sealed and put in a special envelope. Then the canvassing board can quickly determine if a crook cast an illegal ballot in Matthew&#8217;s name or it was a clerical error that can be easily fixed. Either way, Matthew&#8217;s vote will then count.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some confusion on evictions. The feds have blocked them if you fill out an affidavit saying you couldn&#8217;t pay because of COVID. A lot of viewers are getting served with eviction lawsuits and don&#8217;t know what to do with that affidavit.</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;When you get served with the lawsuit, give that affidavit to your landlord. The eviction papers your landlord serves you with will tell you where to respond. Do that quickly and include your affidavit for the judge to read. They will either grant the eviction or allow you to stay in the rental until at least the end of the year.&#8221;</p>
<p>A fellow says a customer came into the job and used what turned out to be a bad credit card. His boss is now making him pay back the money that was stolen. Does he have to?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Generally speaking, an employer cannot require you to pay back the money that came from a fraudulent credit card. Of course, if you refuse, they can fire you, so you have to decide whether to repay or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthew Bryant: &#8220;There was another person with the same last name and the exact same date of birth at a different precinct.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was nothing criminal in Matthew&#8217;s case; it was a clerical error. A poll worker clicked on the wrong name at the polls. Broward corrected it, accepted Matthew&#8217;s vote and made him happy.</p>
<p>Matthew Bryant: &#8220;The system is trustworthy for in-person voting. Looks like it, yeah. My confidence in voting, in in-person voting, has been restored.&#8221;</p>
<p>When you vote in person and there&#8217;s a problem, you know right away. If you cast a mail-in ballot, you can go online to see if your vote has been counted, and if not, contact them to see what can be done to correct it.</p>
<p>And if you have a problem, a question you want us to answer, cast your lot with us. We would love to help you out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Businesses are struggling as COVID continues to crush them, and one South Florida city has decided to more than double the parking rates, leaving one business owner to say, &#8220;Why are you hurting instead of helping us?&#8221; Can a city raise rates during a pandemic? The answer to that and more coronavirus questions is in tonight&#8217;s Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>Egg &amp; You Restaurant has been a Fort Lauderdale favorite for 64 years.</p>
<p>Jean Bartos, Egg &amp; You: &#8220;Oh, breakfast, all kinds of eggs Benedict, waffles, all the breakfast you can imagine.&#8221;</p>
<p>The people who come in to the diner aren&#8217;t just customers. They are longtime friends.</p>
<p>Jean Bartos: &#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s like a big family. We know them, we know their names, and their kids have grown up here.&#8221;</p>
<p>COVID, of course, shut the diner down for four months. The day Jean reopened, her customers were happy with her.</p>
<p>But not the City of Fort Lauderdale.</p>
<p>Jean Bartos: &#8220;The people came in, said, &#8216;Your meters are $2, and I said, &#8216;No, they&#8217;re not,&#8217; and I went to check, and it&#8217;s $2. It was such a surprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>The parking lot near the diner belongs to the city, where it used to cost 75 cents an hour to park. Then, when COVID closed the diner, Fort Lauderdale jumped the rate to a $2 minimum, according to the meter.</p>
<p>Jean Bartos: &#8220;It&#8217;s, like, it&#8217;s really crazy. It&#8217;s really hurting us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why did the city more than double the parking rates? It says on the meter it&#8217;s a &#8220;COVID fee&#8221; to generate cash for Fort Lauderdale.</p>
<p>Jean Bartos: &#8220;They raised it because they were losing money from people not going out, so they had to put the meters up to make up for the loss.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jean says the city might think they are going to make more money, but she fears many customers will say it&#8217;s not worth it to pay $2 for a quick stop.</p>
<p>Jean Bartos: &#8220;If you come to pick up food, it&#8217;s $2. If you come in for a cup of coffee, it&#8217;s $2.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, if you don&#8217;t feed the meter, Fort Lauderdale will make money off that. As we watched, a city employee was writing tickets for the restaurant&#8217;s customers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all so frustrating for Jean.</p>
<p>Jean Bartos: &#8220;We&#8217;re going to end up being closed if we don&#8217;t get people in, because they won&#8217;t pay for parking, so that will lose the city more money than if they&#8217;re going to make increasing the meters.&#8221;</p>
<p>The government closed many businesses because of the pandemic. Now that the surviving businesses are trying to reopen, legally, can the government raise rates to make more money for itself? Howard?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7News legal expert: &#8220;The city commissioners can do whatever they want, and what they want is money, but trying to raise money when taxpayers and business owners are struggling is not the time. Some smart politicians need to step forward in Fort Lauderdale to help instead of hurt people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking of politicians, we are hearing from people who got their election ballots in the mail, but they are paper, so of course, some are damaged. Can you get another mail-in ballot?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Yes, you can actually request an additional ballot twice. Just contact the elections office.&#8221;</p>
<p>But some people are going to say, &#8220;Wait a minute, won&#8217;t that let people turn in two or three ballots?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;No, Patrick. Once a ballot is returned, the computer shows you voted, so your other ballots will be tossed out, and if you also try to vote on Election Day, you won&#8217;t be allowed to vote there, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>A fellow said, when COVID hit, he wasn&#8217;t able to pay his rent. Now that he&#8217;s catching up, his landlord is piling on late fees. Does he have to pay late fees under the emergency order?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;If the lease does not mention late fees, no. If it does include them, yes, but try to reason with the landlord and let them know. If you can&#8217;t pay the late fees, there&#8217;s no reason to pay the late rent, since you will be kicked out anyway for not paying the late fees.&#8221;</p>
<p>We spoke to Fort Lauderdale. They told us they needed the money for city parking facilities and structural repairs. They pointed out a resident could park for 15 minutes at Egg &amp; You and it would cost 50 cents, but they have to call in or use the app to do that.</p>
<p>Jean Bartos: &#8220;A lot of elderly people come here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jean says some of her elderly customers are not tech-savvy and can&#8217;t use the app. She has a better idea for Fort Lauderdale commissioners.</p>
<p>Jean Bartos: &#8220;During the pandemic, it doesn&#8217;t make any sense. They should be helping us and letting people park free.&#8221;</p>
<p>The city could allow customers to park for free to help businesses, just as quickly as they doubled the parking rates that Jean says is hurting businesses.</p>
<p>Got a concern you want people to know about? A problem you want solved? A COVID question you want answered? We are always here for you.</p>
<p>PayByPhone accounts can also be accessed by calling 1-888-680-7275. When using PayByPhone, a service charge of $0.25 (or $0.35 if you elect to receive text message notifications) is automatically added to the hourly rate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>His seizures make his life difficult, so he started using medical marijuana to help, but then, he was told if he smoked it, he could not qualify for disability. Is that true? It&#8217;s tonight&#8217;s Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>For 35 years, he led a normal life.</p>
<p>Ersel Linton, medical marijuana conflict: &#8220;I was perfectly healthy. Basketball, the last job that I had was a IT director.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then, one day, Ersel Linton&#8217;s body betrayed him.</p>
<p>Ersel Linton: &#8220;I started having the seizures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ersel had developed epilepsy and the terrible seizures that come with it.</p>
<p>Ersel Linton: &#8220;I had seizures in the shower, like this, right &#8212; here it was from two weeks ago &#8212; I fell.&#8221;</p>
<p>From busting his head to busting his hand, the sudden seizures kept coming.</p>
<p>Ersel Linton: &#8220;Grand mal seizures is the worst that, you know, you could possibly have. You would lose consciousness, you know, you fall, you know, defecate on yourself, urine on yourself. If you would bite your tongue, it&#8217;s very scary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ersel was given powerful drugs to control the seizures, which, he says, didn&#8217;t stop them and caused serious side effects.</p>
<p>Ersel Linton: &#8220;I would just sit and just cry sometimes because, you know, I&#8217;m so, so, so, so depressed that, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ersel can&#8217;t hold a job anymore and applied for disability, so he won&#8217;t have to depend on his mother to pay his bills.</p>
<p>Then, as the months of seizures dragged on, his neurologist suggested he try medical marijuana once a day. It worked.</p>
<p>Ersel Linton: &#8220;Yes, I have seen a difference in my mood, you know? A difference in my attitude, you know? A difference in my well-being.&#8221;</p>
<p>The medical marijuana also helped reduce the number of seizures, but with that good news came devastating news: when Ersel was told smoking medical marijuana ended his chances of getting disability.</p>
<p>Ersel Linton: &#8220;She said that it&#8217;s clear that I do have a disability, but the fact that I possess the medical marijuana card, you know, denies me from any assistance from the federal government because it&#8217;s still an illegal drug.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ersel says that made no sense to him since the medical marijuana is safer and more effective than the prescribed drugs.</p>
<p>Ersel Linton: &#8220;It&#8217;s a lifesaving drug. It is, it is totally, it is totally unfair.&#8221;</p>
<p>So does using medical marijuana block you from getting federal disability for your seizures, Howard?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7 News Legal Expert: &#8220;No, it should not. Now, if you are a pothead and because of it, you don&#8217;t work, you don&#8217;t get disability, but if you use medical marijuana to treat your seizures, you do get disability. It&#8217;s your right, and in this case, I think there was a misunderstanding in the process.&#8221;</p>
<p>We contacted SSI.</p>
<p>They said medical marijuana does not disqualify an applicant from getting disability, but even if you are disabled, you could be denied if a judge rules you could work at certain jobs.</p>
<p>Ersel says he can&#8217;t even do that.</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Getting disability is a long, difficult process. About two-thirds of the people get their first application denied. You have to keep fighting, and in Ersel&#8217;s case, he has to convince a judge he can&#8217;t hold a job because of his seizures, and I think it&#8217;s clear he is entitled to benefits.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, Ersel waits for the judge&#8217;s decision, stunned at how his life has changed so dramatically since the seizures began.</p>
<p>Ersel Linton: &#8220;Who would, like I would have seizures that bad that, you know, I can&#8217;t do anything. I can&#8217;t even drive.&#8221;</p>
<p>We will keep an eye on Ersel&#8217;s case and let you know what happens. Good luck, sir.</p>
<p>Now, Ersel is fighting this by himself. If you can find a lawyer to represent you, do it.</p>
<p>Some don&#8217;t charge a fee up front but get paid after you win, and they understand how to negotiate the system better than you do.</p>
<p>Speaking of fees, we are free. Our fights are for your rights, and if you are wronged, we will try to wipe away your woes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She cancelled cable and internet but then found out eight months later she was still being billed for it. Can she get back her money? It&#8217;s tonight&#8217;s Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>Maria is a very independent woman.</p>
<p>Justo Soler, helping mother: &#8220;Sometimes, she sends the caretaker home early because she wants her privacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>One thing she likes to do: watch her favorite TV station.</p>
<p>Maria Arguelles: &#8220;Oh, Channel 7, the number one, the number one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since she can get Channel 7 with her antenna, last year, Maria decided to save money and cancelled her cable and internet.</p>
<p>Justo Soler: &#8220;She was paying $251.87 a month debited from her account, so that&#8217;s the reason my mother cancelled. She was not using all the features.&#8221;</p>
<p>Justo says he returned the cable equipment in December. Then, recently, after checking his mother&#8217;s bills, his antenna went up.</p>
<p>Justo Soler: &#8220;She&#8217;s being debited for a service of internet, telephone and TV.&#8221;</p>
<p>Justo contacted the company, and he says they confirmed the equipment was returned eight months ago, but when he asked for the money Maria had paid for those eight months, he got another surprise.</p>
<p>Justo Soler: &#8220;And they told me that their system could only give us a credit back two months.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, the 88-year-old Maria was irritated.</p>
<p>Maria Arguelles: &#8220;If I don&#8217;t receive a service, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair that they&#8217;re charging me for something they&#8217;re not providing.&#8221;</p>
<p>You often hear people say it&#8217;s not about the money. In this case, it&#8217;s about the money.</p>
<p>Justo Soler: &#8220;She can buy a lot of medicine with this credit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maria Arguelles: &#8220;It&#8217;s a lot of money. It&#8217;s my money!&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, Maria was billed for a service she didn&#8217;t get. Howard, does she get her money back?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7 News Legal Expert: &#8220;As long as you return all of the equipment and have proof of that, they have to give you all your money back. They can argue you also have to cancel after you return the equipment, but the return of the equipment is basically the cancellation since you can&#8217;t get the service without the equipment.&#8221;</p>
<p>A viewer said a coworker was out for a few days with COVID, but the company kept it a secret. When the fellow came back, they believe he infected another employee. Can they sue the coworker or the company?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;The company doesn&#8217;t have to tell you if a coworker tests positive, but if he or she comes back to work with the virus and you contract it, you could sue the company or your coworker, or you might not be able to sue either one. That&#8217;s because you have to prove they knew, that they were negligent and you got it from the coworker. As a lawsuit, it&#8217;s a long shot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some viewers qualified for rental assistance but didn&#8217;t get it because their landlord refused to provide the necessary documents. Does a landlord have to cooperate?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;No, the landlord does not have to fill out the forms, and then, they don&#8217;t get that money for rent. Why would a landlord do that? Because the rental assistance is reported to the federal government, and the landlord has to pay taxes on it, some landlords collect cash for rent and don&#8217;t report it to the government to avoid paying federal taxes.&#8221;</p>
<p>After we contacted the cable company, they got in touch with Justo, and he says they told him not only did a customer have to return the equipment, after that they had to cancel the service, but they did agree to return three more months of payments, giving Maria about $1,000 back, leaving a happy mother and son.</p>
<p>Justo Soler: &#8220;I cannot thank Channel 7 and the staff enough for helping my mother get her money back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maria Arguelles: &#8220;God bless all the family in Channel 7.&#8221;</p>
<p>Awwww, that&#8217;s so sweet of you, Maria. Glad we could help.</p>
<p>When you return equipment, whether it&#8217;s a car or a cable box, get proof in writing you returned it, and everything is fine. Justo didn&#8217;t have the receipt, which complicated things, but we were able to help.</p>
<p>Contracted a problem that&#8217;s left you powerless? Don&#8217;t be remote? Turn to us, and let us channel some of our solutions to you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The governor has lifted his ban on evicting renters, but the federal government says you can&#8217;t evict some renters. Confusing? It can be, and it&#8217;s why we brought in Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser to clear it all up for landlords and tenants.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult for everyone. Tenants lost their jobs, and they can&#8217;t pay rent, and landlords still have to pay the mortgage on the property.</p>
<p>Now, as the state ban on evictions is lifted, while the federal ban kicks in, it&#8217;s about to become chaotic.</p>
<p>Nordia Paul: &#8220;&#8216;Cause right now I have hardship. This is hardship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ardrekra Latimore: &#8220;Very &#8212; very scared.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin with Ardrekra, a single mom, a renter with both hands full.</p>
<p>Ardrekra Latimore: &#8220;I have three boys and two girls, and it&#8217;s hard managing right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the coronavirus hit, Ardrekra lost her job as a security guard, couldn&#8217;t pay the rent, and her car was repossessed.</p>
<p>Ardrekra Latimore: &#8220;Yes, I have applied for unemployment. They haven&#8217;t responded to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>As it becomes easier to evict tenants, Ardrekra&#8217;s landlord is vowing to make her life even worse.</p>
<p>Ardrekra Latimore: &#8220;She gave me a call and was, like, that I would be evicted. I have my kids. You are just going to kick us out? Where are we gonna go? With no shelter, no nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ardrekra found a job but does not have the money to pay the back rent, and she fears she and her five children will be homeless.</p>
<p>Ardrekra Latimore: &#8220;I&#8217;ve never been evicted before, so I don&#8217;t know what to expect.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the face of a mother fearing eviction.</p>
<p>The state now allows evictions, but the federal order bans some evictions. Howard, what can renters expect?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7News legal expert: &#8220;You can block the eviction if you can prove you can&#8217;t pay the rent. The key here: you have to fill out an affidavit swearing that you have experienced a substantial loss of household income because of layoff or furlough. You also have to prove you have tried to make partial rent payments, and you would become homeless if evicted. Then you have to turn that affidavit over to your landlord.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there are the landlords like Nordia, who tried to be understanding to their renter.</p>
<p>Nordia Paul, tenant wouldn&#8217;t pay rent: &#8220;If you can&#8217;t pay, that&#8217;s understanding. Let&#8217;s work it out, let&#8217;s come up with something, &#8217;cause anything is better than nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nordia&#8217;s tenant wouldn&#8217;t pay anything for the house, even though she was still working.</p>
<p>Nordia Paul: &#8220;Texting me, &#8216;I have to talk to you later. At work in a meeting,&#8217; but you can&#8217;t pay your rent. Really? Wow.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Nordia has a mortgage on the property. She has to pay the bank or lose her house.</p>
<p>Nordia Paul: &#8220;I had to pick up extra shifts. I had to pick up extra hours, just so I can pay the mortgage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tenant owed Nordia $6,000 in back rent. When we contacted them, they told us they did not have the money to pay the back rent.</p>
<p>Nordia Paul: &#8220;I want them out. They have gotten their free ride, and the ride is over now. Get out, get out, leave. You have already got three months. Get out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, Howard, Nordia has a tenant she says is using COVID as an excuse to stop paying rent. Can Nordia now evict her?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Yes. If the landlord can prove the tenant can pay the rent, they just need to go through the normal eviction process and get the judge to sign the order to throw them out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nordia Paul: &#8220;It&#8217;s Nordia, the landlord, trying to get a hold of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Good news for Nordia: her tenant started paying rent, caught up and then moved out.</p>
<p>Ardrekra Latimore: &#8220;Freaking out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The news is not as good for Ardrekra. She got a job and got laid off from that. She will fill out that federal paperwork to avoid eviction, but she lives in fear every day of being homeless.</p>
<p>Ardrekra Latimore: &#8220;I&#8217;m looking for work. Give me a chance. Can I try some type of payment?&#8221;</p>
<p>The evictions are going to slowly begin. To see if you qualify under the federal rules to avoid being evicted, go to the links at the bottom of this Help Me Howard for that information plus the form to fill out. Also, there are links to information about your rights as a tenant and a landlord.</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;And if you have a problem or questions, whether its COVID-related or not, get in touch with us. We will do everything we can to help you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A South Florida man can only use hand sanitizers without alcohol, but his gym requires members use their alcohol-based sanitizer. Can they do that? The answer to that and more in tonight&#8217;s Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>Jaye could be one of those before and after pictures.</p>
<p>This was Jaye in 2016. This is Jaye today.</p>
<p>Jaye Allen: &#8220;I was 310 pounds about four years ago. I lost over 70 pounds, so the gym is my release.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gym makes him happy, and now with COVID, the gym is creating a headache.</p>
<p>Jaye Allen: &#8220;I do get tested for alcohol and narcotics, and the one thing they tell you to use is to stay away from all alcohol-based products &#8212; sanitizers, mouthwashes, things of that nature.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of a court-ordered deal, Jaye carries his own alcohol-free sanitizer, and then, one day, he walked into his gym where the manager told him he had to use their hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>Jaye Allen: &#8220;The reason I had to use his was because he knows what&#8217;s is in his hand sanitizer, and he doesn&#8217;t know what&#8217;s in mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jaye showed them the alcohol-free sanitizer he uses and explained if he used their sanitizer with alcohol, he could get in trouble.</p>
<p>Jaye Allen: &#8220;And he pretty much told me that that&#8217;s fabrication. That is not correct, it&#8217;s not accurate and that if I want to use his gym, I must use his hand sanitizer, and I cannot provide my own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jaye tried to reason with the gym manager &#8212; didn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>Jaye Allen: &#8220;He mentioned that there&#8217;s a $15,000 fine, that he&#8217;s not putting himself at risk, and that either I use his hand sanitizer or I have to find somewhere else to work out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The manager says he will be fined by the county if he lets Jaye use his own hand sanitizer. Is the manager right or wrong, Howard?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7 News Legal Expert: &#8220;He&#8217;s wrong. The county order requires the gym to provide sanitizer for its staff and customers, but it does not say anything about a customer using their own hand sanitizer or just soap and water, so Jaye can use his own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many people who are not paying rent have not been evicted because of the state and federal eviction bans.</p>
<p>One fellow said his landlord won&#8217;t fix a broken appliance until he pays the rent. Is that legal for the landlord to do?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;No, because you have a contract, and your landlord has to maintain the rental, but the tenant is out of luck because your remedy is to send a seven-day letter threatening to withhold rent or move out if the appliance is not fixed, but you aren&#8217;t paying rent, and you can&#8217;t move out, so a tenant really can&#8217;t do anything about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The coronavirus moved Florida into what the governor calls Phase Three, lifting many restrictions, but a condo owner said their board still won&#8217;t open the pools and other amenities, even though residents are paying for pool maintenance. Does the board have to open things now, and if not, when?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;No, they still do not. Because the board has the obligation to keep the community safe, they do not have to open the amenities when they think it&#8217;s appropriate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jaye Allen: &#8220;I&#8217;m very happy that you guys were able to help me sort things out.&#8221;</p>
<p>And we did. The gym rep told us they spoke to Jaye and &#8220;apologized for the misinterpretation of the Broward County order,&#8221; adding he is &#8220;welcome to bring his own hand sanitizer&#8221; to the gym, leaving them with a happy customer.</p>
<p>Jaye Allen: &#8220;No, no hard feelings. You know, at the end of the day, what I thought was right by the client was ultimately done. That&#8217;s what I was asking for.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the way you run a business. If you make a mistake, admit it and move on, and if you have a problem you can&#8217;t solve, a question you want answered, remember we have been here for 21 years helping you, and we are not about to stop when you need us more than ever.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She got taken by one of those check scams you might have heard about, and then something you don’t hear about: Her bank came after her as well. Plus, does a teacher returning to the classroom get worker&#8217;s comp if they contract the coronavirus? Those answers and more in Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>When you walk into Mary’s back yard, you are reminded of how wonderful big shade trees are.</p>
<p>Mary Beth Fleck, stunned by scammer and bank: &#8220;It really is a slice of heaven. This yard has been a lifesaver.&#8221;</p>
<p>A lifesaver for Mary, because recently, her life has become a mess.</p>
<p>Mary Beth Fleck: “I was the victim of fraud. I was the victim.”</p>
<p>When COVID hit, Mary could no longer organize fundraisers for various groups. Without a paycheck, she went online and thought she found a job where she could work from home.</p>
<p>Mary Beth Fleck: “Provide you all the equipment and I said, ‘Oh, this is it. This is where I&#8217;ll be able to make some money.&#8217;”</p>
<p>That day, Mary had 73 cents in her checking account, so when the company sent a $3,210 check to her, she went straight to the bank, excited but cautious.</p>
<p>Mary Beth Fleck: “I even said to the gal, ‘Is this a legitimate check?’ and she was like, ‘Oh, yeah, we get these all the time.’”</p>
<p>The crook had told Mary to buy $2,000 in eBay cards and send it to a business for the equipment to do her new job.</p>
<p>Mary did. A couple of days later, she got a call from her bank.</p>
<p>Mary Beth Fleck: “She said, ‘Check was fraudulent. You owe us all that money,’ and she said, ‘We&#8217;re going to prosecute you. It&#8217;s for the fraudulent check,&#8217; and I just lost it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Believe it or not, it got worse. Mary didn’t have the money to give to the bank, so they turned her over to a collection agency.</p>
<p>Mary Beth Fleck: “His response was, ‘Sorry, I was hired by this bank to get the money.’ It&#8217;s brought me to my knees, because I started to cry.”</p>
<p>In March, COVID took her job. In June, a crook scammed her, and in September, a bank hammered her.</p>
<p>Mary Beth Fleck: “Why am I responsible? Your bank cashed the check. I asked if it was legitimate, and I was assured by the teller it was.”</p>
<p>Well, if you get taken by a check scammer, can you be prosecuted and have to pay it back to the bank as well, Howard?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7News legal expert: &#8220;Mary did nothing wrong, so she cannot be prosecuted for any crime, and if the bank told her the check was good, and she could prove that, they might be responsible for the loss, but odds are, you cannot prove it, and in that case, even though you got taken by the scammer, you have to repay the money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Federal law requires banks to release the money from the check within a few days, but it takes longer to determine if the check is worthless. Is there a way to avoid that?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Either don&#8217;t touch the money until it clears or go to the bank that it was issued from. They can determine right away if it’s a good check, and you can cash it immediately or know it&#8217;s a scam.”</p>
<p>The Broward Elections Supervisor said, because you have a federal right to vote, if you don’t want to follow the county order to wear a mask in the precinct, you can vote without a mask. Can he ignore the county mask order?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;In my opinion, no. It&#8217;s also a local order you cannt smoke inside a building, so is it now OK to smoke a cigar while you vote? Of course not, and that’s why I believe, legally, you have to wear a mask while you vote.&#8221;</p>
<p>We heard from a teacher who wants to return to the classroom, but if she goes back to work and contracts the coronavirus at school, will she get paid or get worker&#8217;s comp?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;You can use sick leave or vacation time, but after that runs out, you have to prove you contracted COVID at school to get worker&#8217;s comp. How do you prove you got it there and didn’t get it at a gas station or a grocery store? It’s a slippery slope, and right now, it’s going to be fascinating to see how school districts treat these teachers and administrators.”</p>
<p>I spoke to the bank. Good news for Mary: they are going to stop their bill collector, and then, talk to her next year about repaying that money. That’s good, because Mary has a job now, as well as advice for anyone desperate in this COVID era for money who gets taken by a scammer.</p>
<p>Mary Beth Fleck: &#8220;Don&#8217;t beat yourself up for it, because I&#8217;ve beaten myself up. I mean, here I am with a master&#8217;s degree. How could I have gotten snookered for something like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;And remember, if someone sends you a check and says send some of that money to them or someone else, it’s a scam. No one sends checks like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Got a problem uprooting you? Branch out and call us. You can bank on us to check things out for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>He had a winning lottery ticket worth $1,000, and then the state unemployment office took his winnings and would not tell him why.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when he called Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>The coronavirus has made cash tight for a lot of people, and it&#8217;s why Armando was hoping for some luck in the lottery.</p>
<p>Armando Lopez, Jr.: &#8220;I never won nothing in the lottery before.&#8221;</p>
<p>COVID time would be a perfect time for Armando to win since his wife lost her job and his income has taken a big drop.</p>
<p>Armando Lopez, Jr.: &#8220;Drained, I&#8217;m super stressing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he scratched off those lottery tickets&#8230;</p>
<p>Armando Lopez, Jr.: &#8220;And the only one that was $1,000 winner is the one that we got, and we started jumping to joy. We&#8217;re super happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>$1,000 in the middle of the pandemic. Armando knew exactly where it would be spent.</p>
<p>Armando Lopez, Jr.: &#8220;And once we saw that scratch off like I&#8217;m saying thank God that we won $1,000. That was 90% of my rent right there with all $5 scratch off.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the lottery offices closed, Armando mailed in the winning ticket to get his money, then was told he wasn&#8217;t getting the cash because the unemployment office claimed he owed them money, and so they grabbed it.</p>
<p>Armando Lopez, Jr.: &#8220;&#8216;Do you recall getting unemployment?&#8217; I said no, I&#8217;ve been working for the past 20 years. I don&#8217;t remember collecting unemployment. I do not have no child support. I do not have no IRS debt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Armando said he tried to contact the unemployment office to let them know he didn&#8217;t owe them anything. As you might be aware, it&#8217;s easier to win a billion-dollar lottery than get through the unemployment system.</p>
<p>Armando Lopez, Jr.: &#8220;I had called maybe 20, 30 times, maybe. Maybe less, maybe more. I even called Tallahassee.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one could or would explain why they grabbed his lottery winnings, and so, Armando waits.</p>
<p>Armando Lopez, Jr.: &#8220;That&#8217;s why you play to win, as they say, and I&#8217;m still standing here waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, Howard, can the state take your lottery winnings and not explain why?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Yes, the lottery office is required to take it if you owe child support or money to any government agency, but in this case, the unemployment then has to show why you owe the money. If they cannot, Armando is entitled to get the winnings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next up, COVID has many public school teachers afraid to return to the classroom when Dade and Broward go back to in-person learning. Howard, if they don&#8217;t go, can they be fired?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;This is going to be complicated. Teachers can use any leave or vacation days. Some can file under the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Family Medical Leave Act to stay home even though you don&#8217;t get paid, or they can ask for a leave of absence, but if they don&#8217;t qualify for any of that, legally, it&#8217;s not yet clear if they can be fired.</p>
<p>Some people are nervous about voting in November in person and want a mail-in ballot, but they have asked us if they have to meet certain qualifications to get that ballot. Do you?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Many states require you to be disabled or be out of town on election day to get a mail-in ballot, but not Florida. Any registered voter can get that ballot. All you just have to ask your elections office is to mail it to you. The links to do that are at wsvn.com under this story.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is one: At a restaurant, a viewer was told, because of COVID, they would not let him pay with cash, only a credit card. Can a business refuse cash in America?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;This is easy. Yes, a business can refuse cash and only accept credit cards.</p>
<p>We got the unemployment office to talk to Armando. They told him he owed around $800 plus interest for unemployment he got back in 2001. They got the wrong guy, said Armando, and he is filing a dispute to get his lottery winnings, leaving him irritated with the state of Florida.</p>
<p>Armando Lopez, Jr.: &#8220;Super annoyed, super frustrated, and I like playing with the hope of winning the lottery, winning a big prize of a scratch-off. I don&#8217;t even play no more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Battling the bureaucracy when you can go into an office and sit down with a human being is tough. Battling the state when it&#8217;s all online and anonymous&#8230; talk about frustrating.</p>
<p>Now, if you have a problem you can&#8217;t resolve, a COVID question you want to get answered, get in touch with us.<br />
We are here to help you out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A campaign sign is creating controversy, not because of what it says, but where it is placed. The sign is on one person&#8217;s property, but it&#8217;s blocking another person&#8217;s view. Are you allowed to put a political sign anywhere you want on your property? It&#8217;s tonight&#8217;s Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>Some people like Donald Trump, some people like Joe Biden, and in this Fort Lauderdale neighborhood, a lot of people want you to know who they like.</p>
<p>Sue Chatlos: &#8220;A lot of opinionated people in the area, which is good &#8230; for the most part.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sue and her husband Mark are Biden fans with a &#8216;Dump Trump&#8217; flag in their backyard above their &#8216;Dogs Against Trump&#8217; sign. In the front yard, they have an Anybody But Trump sign along with this one supporting Black Lives Matter, women&#8217;s rights, science and kindness.</p>
<p>Sue Chatlos: &#8220;It&#8217;s a very sweet sign. We have people that stop and take pictures of the front of the house because they think it&#8217;s great.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her next-door neighbor is a Trump fan with a flag in his front yard.</p>
<p>Sue Chatlos: &#8220;And I&#8217;m fine with it. I&#8217;m like, &#8216;That&#8217;s OK. I mean, if that&#8217;s the way you lean, then that&#8217;s your choice. It&#8217;s not my choice, but I respect that choice.'&#8221;</p>
<p>But the trouble started in the backyard where Sue and Mark like to sit, relax and look across their neighbor&#8217;s yard to watch the boats go by.</p>
<p>Sur Chatlos: &#8220;Oh, I love sitting there. It&#8217;s wonderful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then their neighbor put up a Trump 2020 sign where they sit and blocked Sue and Mark from seeing the boats go by.</p>
<p>Sue Chatlos: &#8220;That property has over 100 feet of waterfront. He could have put it anywhere, but he put it right in front of the chairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>This section of the fence is the only part you can see over. The rest of the fence is too tall.</p>
<p>Sue called her neighbor and asked his wife if he would move the sign. No, because&#8230;</p>
<p>Sue Chatlos: &#8220;And she said to me, &#8216;Well, I know he was upset because of your degrading signs that you would put up.&#8217; He stewed about it, about our flags, and he found those degrading.&#8221;</p>
<p>They say politics is dirty, but this Biden-Trump feud has turned into a backyard battle.</p>
<p>Sue Chatlos: &#8220;But just to put it in front of where we sit, I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t get it. I don&#8217;t get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, Howard, can you put your political sign anywhere you want on your property?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Yes, you can put it anywhere you want to with one exception. The law that says you cannot put up a sign just to spite your neighbor. You have to have a reason for putting it there, And in this case, Sue&#8217;s neighbor can say the people going by in their boat might be influenced by his sign in the upcoming election, and while it might be more visible by the canal, there is no legal requirement to put it there, so he can leave it on the other side of his yard.&#8221;</p>
<p>I tried to contact Sue&#8217;s neighbor to see if he would move the sign to another part of the yard. He did not return our calls, and it brings up the question, can the sign stay up after the election?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;In all likelihood, it has to come down because the election is over, and then it&#8217;s only there to spite the neighbors, but he could replace it with a Happy New Year sign.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sign blocking her view disappoints Sue, but she says nothing will block her on Election Day.</p>
<p>Sue Chatlos: &#8220;People have got to get out and vote, and they&#8217;ve got to show what they really feel, and that&#8217;s my only recourse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vote. Hopefully, everyone will vote. And while most cities don&#8217;t regulate political signs because of the Supreme Court ruling, the court did let condo and homeowner associations regulate signs, so before you put one up, check to see if you can, or if you just put it up, your association will let you know if you can.</p>
<p>Flagged by a problem that&#8217;s left you blowing in the breeze? Campaigning for some help? Sign up with us, and let us unfurl a solution for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A South Florida homeowner runs into a bit of a property problem. She had to access her neighbor&#8217;s property, so crews could work on a section of her home, but her neighbor said, &#8220;No.&#8221; It&#8217;s tonight&#8217;s Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>Daisy Fernandez: &#8220;No, no, I took down the roof. Does she know that the water piping goes through there?&#8221;</p>
<p>We first met Daisy back in a different era &#8212; back in January, when the only people who wore masks outside were bank robbers.</p>
<p>Daisy Fernandez: &#8220;Back there is where they had the efficiency.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daisy and her husband wanted to touch up their house.</p>
<p>Daisy Fernandez: &#8220;I need to finish the side of the house and the edge of the roof.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daisy lives in a zero lot line neighborhood, meaning you own the land of one side of your house, and your neighbor owns the property on the other side of the house.</p>
<p>Daisy Fernandez: &#8220;My husband started talking to her husband to make sure that we could, neighbor to neighbor, get everything straightened out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, when you need to work on the side of the house your neighbor controls, they have to give you access to the four feet near your home to do the work.</p>
<p>Patrick Fraser: &#8220;Did you ask her?&#8221;</p>
<p>Daisy Fernandez: &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patrick Fraser: &#8220;And?&#8221;</p>
<p>Daisy Fernandez: &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daisy called the county to complain. An inspector came out and uncovered a problem with her neighbor&#8217;s property.</p>
<p>Daisy Fernandez: &#8220;She had an efficiency, illegal. Her shed was illegal. The fence was illegal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her neighbor had to remove the efficiency, this part of the roof and the fence, but now, her neighbor wasn&#8217;t about to let Daisy&#8217;s construction crew come in her yard.</p>
<p>Patrick Fraser: &#8220;So she&#8217;s not happy with you and you&#8217;re not happy with her?&#8221;</p>
<p>Daisy Fernandez: &#8220;I have to live next to her. I have to be happy. It&#8217;s just that I want to fix my house.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Daisy can&#8217;t fix the problem and has discovered no one else can help, either.</p>
<p>Daisy Fernandez: &#8220;I keep calling the zoning department. I keep calling my commissioner. They tell me they cannot do anything about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems everyone tells Daisy she can&#8217;t force her neighbor to give her access to this side of the property, or Howard, can she?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7 News Legal Expert: &#8220;Absolutely. In a zero lot line community, the law gives you access to four feet of your neighbor&#8217;s property to maintain it. If they won&#8217;t let you in, hire an attorney to ask a judge to order them to let you in. In most cases, your neighbor will have to pay your attorney and any courts costs you incurred. In Daisy&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s a slam dunk, and she will win.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daisy&#8217;s neighbors were not easy to work with.</p>
<p>They ignored our calls and emails asking them to follow the law.</p>
<p>Then, I sent them an email explaining that an attorney was going to sue them to get Daisy access to their property, and the judge could then order them to pay Daisy&#8217;s legal fees if she won.</p>
<p>That, apparently, is what did it.</p>
<p>A day later, they let the contractor in their yard to finish Daisy&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>Daisy Fernandez: &#8220;Everything looks fine and dandy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Look at before and after, the house does look great. It just took Daisy a while to get it that way.</p>
<p>Daisy Fernandez: &#8220;Thank you to all of you for helping us. After you guys got involved, the process went very smoothly, thank God.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glad we could help you, Daisy.</p>
<p>Now, how do you know if your property is in a zero lot line neighborhood? It should be on the property survey, and if you do not live in a zero lot line neighborhood, do you have the right to go through the side of your neighbor&#8217;s property? Say to bring equipment in to build a pool?</p>
<p>Nope, you need their permission.</p>
<p>Getting zero help trying to solve a problem? Need access to a solution? Survey the scene and contact us. Stepping up is the neighborly thing to do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When COVID hit, many elderly people smartly decided to stay home to not go out and contract the disease. Food programs then started delivering meals for them to eat, but one woman who can&#8217;t leave her house got dropped from the food service, and that&#8217;s when her family called Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>2020 started off OK for Barbara and her parents. Then COVID hit.</p>
<p>In March, Barbara lost her job. In April, her father passed away.</p>
<p>Barbara Colegrove: &#8220;I am absolutely overwhelmed.&#8221;</p>
<p>As an only child, Barbara was left to look after her 84-year-old mother, and that&#8217;s when she heard about Miami-Dade County&#8217;s emergency food program.</p>
<p>Barbara Colegrove: &#8220;It&#8217;s meals for the elderly, and if I was not able to come and provide for her or help her out, then at least she had that. One less thing to worry about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once a week, the county delivered seven frozen dinners to Aracelia, and she loved it.</p>
<p>Aracelia Almeria (translation of): &#8220;Yes, it was of great help.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barbara Colegrove: &#8220;This was a blessing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then suddenly, the meals stopped showing up.</p>
<p>Barbara Colegrove: &#8220;Claimed that the delivery driver called the phone and no one answered. She&#8217;s been disqualified from the program, and there&#8217;s nothing they can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barbara said they never got a call about a delivery.</p>
<p>A year ago she would have handled this problem, but this year, after COVID, losing her job, burying her father, worrying about her mother, it&#8217;s just all too much for her.</p>
<p>Barbara Colegrove: &#8220;A little frustrated, and I&#8217;m sad, going through the loss of my father, and now having to deal with this worry. It&#8217;s very hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so Barbara called Help Me Howard with the question: the food is supplied by the county for free. If you are a senior citizen, legally, are you entitled to it.</p>
<p>Howard, you are up.</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7News legal expert: &#8220;You can dance on a legal pin about whether a senior citizen is entitled to this emergency government program that supplies one meal a day, but we are talking about food, and if an elderly person needs it, give it to them, whether they answered their phone or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another question about an older relative. The governor lifted the order barring visitors from nursing homes, but South Floridians are telling us they still can&#8217;t get into the nursing home to see their parents. Can the facility block them?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Yes. Part of the governor&#8217;s order lays out rules that have to be followed before visitors are allowed in. If the nursing home can&#8217;t meet those standards, they cannot let visitors in.&#8221;</p>
<p>This one is a little morbid, but it&#8217;s life today. A cemetery employee wants to know if he has the right to know if a body he is lowering into the ground died of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;No. Since most COVID victims are in a body bag in a sealed casket, you are not in any danger, and you have no right to be told what the person died of.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went to urgent care for a problem, and while she was there, they tested her for COVID. She got a bill for that, and she thought COVID tests were free. Are they?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;If you have insurance, they pay, but otherwise it depends on where you get the test. Some places are free, and some are not. Make sure you ask before you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aracelia Almeria (translation of): &#8220;They brought it to me very fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>Give Miami-Dade all the credit. We contacted the emergency meals service in the morning. That afternoon, they delivered the meals to Aracelia and added some fresh fruit and vegetables for her.</p>
<p>Aracelia Almeria (translation of): &#8220;You were the ones who did the work, and I need to tell you, I&#8217;m very thankful for what you did for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;The Miami-Dade meals programs is funded by tax money, so when you say, &#8216;Where do all my taxes go?&#8217; at least you know some of it is being well spent.&#8221;</p>
<p>A half-baked problem burning you up? Hungry for someone to cook up a solution? Let us take a bite out of it, &#8217;cause our plate is never too full to help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Their cruise was cancelled, their trips ruined by the COVID pandemic, but their newest problem is the cruise line&#8217;s fault because they won&#8217;t return their money. It&#8217;s why many passengers contacted Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>Many businesses have been crushed by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Safe to say, none have been hit harder than the cruise lines, affecting both the ship owners and their customers.</p>
<p>Sherri Benevisto, can&#8217;t get cruise refund: &#8220;We were going to Venice and to Greece. We were going for my husband&#8217;s 60th birthday and for our 35th wedding anniversary.&#8221;</p>
<p>But of course, every cruise line shut down. Every cruise was cancelled, and now, seven months later, many customers are still sunk.</p>
<p>Sherri Benevisto: &#8220;I&#8217;m not getting my money back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sherri is not the only one. Looking at our recent Help Me Howard emails, 13 customers told us they can&#8217;t get their money back from their cruise line.</p>
<p>This woman wrote, &#8220;I cancelled in March, and 166 days later, all I get is the runaround as I try to get a refund.&#8221;</p>
<p>This fellow said he cancelled in March, and &#8220;they keep telling me my refund is pending.&#8221;</p>
<p>This fellow wrote that he and 18 of his friends had cancelled and were having a problem getting a full refund.</p>
<p>In Sherri&#8217;s case, the cruise line said she didn&#8217;t fill out the refund form properly. Not true, she says.</p>
<p>Sherri Benevisto: &#8220;I filled it out right because I have a form saying I filled it out right.&#8221;</p>
<p>But seven months later, Sherri has not been able to convince the cruise line she got it right and they got it wrong.</p>
<p>Sherri Benevisto: &#8220;If I did it wrong, OK. It&#8217;s my fault, I understand that, but show me where I did wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cruise line told her we will give you credit for another trip. No, Sherri says, she wants her cash back.</p>
<p>Sherri Benevisto: &#8220;I paid close to $15,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>Losing $15,000 to a cruise line in a pandemic. Imagine that feeling.</p>
<p>Sherri Benevisto: &#8220;The other day, I was hysterical crying.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been seven months since cruises started getting cancelled, so Howard, how long do cruise lines before they have to return passengers&#8217; money?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7 News Legal Expert: &#8220;They have a reasonable amount of time to return the money, but seven months is not reasonable at all. They have to return passengers&#8217; money now. If they don&#8217;t, they have to be careful because some attorney might file a class action lawsuit and cost the cruise lines a lot more money.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few people told us they took the voucher for a future trip instead of a refund, but now, they don&#8217;t want a cruise in their future. Can they convert the voucher into a refund?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Legally, no. Once you accepted the voucher, you agreed to a contract, and you cannot force the cruise line to convert the voucher into a cash refund.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another travel-related question: their 8-year-old son has autism and cannot wear a mask. They were thrown off an airline because he couldn&#8217;t keep the mask on. Can an airline do that?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;This is a great question. The Americans with Disabilities Act gives you the right to reasonable accommodations, but if the accommodation creates a &#8216;direct threat&#8217; to the health of others, you don&#8217;t get the accommodation, and the airline can block you from boarding.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sherri Benevisto: &#8220;I do feel I&#8217;m entitled to that money.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the cruise line, they told us they made a mistake, and that Sherri and her husband were entitled to a full refund and would be getting that $15,000 back.</p>
<p>Sherri Benevisto: &#8220;It was supposed to be the time of our lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of that cruise to Greece, they celebrated that anniversary and birthday in a more familiar spot.</p>
<p>Sherri Benevisto: &#8220;We stayed in the house and went in the backyard and pool, and we had a barbecue because that&#8217;s all you&#8217;re allowed to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;That&#8217;s nice, not as memorable as a cruise to Greece, but I bet their barbeque was good.&#8221;</p>
<p>And glad we were able to find the right person, so they could get that $15,000 back. That&#8217;s a lot of money at any time.</p>
<p>Got a problem that&#8217;s got you anchored down? Need someone to sail in and help you? Get aboard with us, and let us &#8220;seas&#8221; the day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cigar bars are allowed to stay open but not hookah lounges, and people can play tennis together but not volleyball. The COVID rules are causing confusion for some in South Florida, in tonight&#8217;s Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>Labor Day celebrates hardworking Americans, like Claudia, where every day is a labor of love.</p>
<p>Claudia Herman: “I work 15 hours a day approximately. I love my business.”</p>
<p>Claudia has owned D&#8217;vine Hookah Lounge for 17 years. A place to eat, drink, and of course, smoke flavored tobaccos through a hookah.</p>
<p>Then Miami-Dade&#8217;s mayor sent her business up in a puff of smoke.</p>
<p>Claudia Herman: “It&#8217;s sad, because, since they put ban, my business went down 90%.”</p>
<p>The county order said Claudia can sell drinks, can serve food, but can’t allow customers to smoke hookah, even though Claudia says it’s safe since she doesn’t allow them to share the hookah.</p>
<p>Claudia Herman: “This is a disposable hose. You use it once, and then every person gets a mouthpiece. You smoke, you throw it out, you come back, you disinfect the hookah.”</p>
<p>Claudia says the county order is also unfair, because while one person can’t smoke a hookah, people are smoking in a cigar bar.</p>
<p>Claudia Herman: &#8220;This is the same as smoking a cigarette, smoking a cigar, smoking a vapor, and the other people are allowed to smoke.&#8221;</p>
<p>Claudia is right. We went to a cigar bar that is open.</p>
<p>So, Howard, why can people smoke a cigar in one shop but not a hookah in another?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: “In Miami-Dade, the emergency order specifically says hookah bars can open for food and alcohol but not smoking hookah. Why can a cigar bar be open? It doesn’t make much sense, so the county needs to either close cigar bars or open hookah bars, but not treat them differently. That doesn’t seem fair.”</p>
<p>The county told us if they hear about a cigar bar with people smoking, they will explain the rules to the owner.</p>
<p>For Kiara, volleyball is also a labor of love.</p>
<p>Kiara Alietti: “I&#8217;ve been playing for such a long time, and it&#8217;s just become my life. I absolutely love it.”</p>
<p>Playing volleyball is fun right now for the 16-year-old, and it’s also part of her future.</p>
<p>Kiara Alietti: “I want to play college volleyball, and in order to do that, I need to practice, practice, practice, practice.”</p>
<p>But Kiara can’t practice on Miami Beach because the county says no activity with two or more people is allowed.</p>
<p>Kiara says that makes no sense.</p>
<p>Kiara Alietti: “Gyms have already been opened, and they&#8217;re enclosed. There&#8217;s hundreds of gear that people are going to be constantly touching.”</p>
<p>If Kiara practiced in the fresh air with another player, she would get in trouble, but 50 people can work out in a gym side by side.</p>
<p>The teenage Kiara thinks she knows why she is treated differently.</p>
<p>Kiara Alietti: “I feel like they&#8217;re so focused on, like, what makes money, like beach volleyball isn&#8217;t going to make money for them.”</p>
<p>In Dade and Broward, two people can’t play volleyball on the beach, but 50 people can work out in a gym.</p>
<p>Howard, legally, does that make sense?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: “No, and people can play tennis but cannot play volleyball. What’s clear here is the rules are vague, and while the government officials say they are just relying on their medical experts, something is wrong. It’s been nearly seven months, and it’s now clear businesses and people are not being treated equally, and it’s the job of the government officials to correct the unequal treatment.”</p>
<p>Kiara’s request: it can’t hurt for two people to play volleyball on the beach.</p>
<p>Kiara Alietti: “I would say to the officials: &#8216;Open the courts, please.&#8217;”</p>
<p>Claudia&#8217;s belief: the county is about to crush her and her employees.</p>
<p>Claudia Herman: &#8220;It&#8217;s like 25 families that will go out of business. We will not have a job. It&#8217;s really sad, and it&#8217;s like nobody cares.”</p>
<p>It’s just heartbreaking to see a business you spent 17 years creating go down the drain and they can’t do anything about it, and we hear from so many business owners seeing their dreams dissolve from COVID logic that makes no sense to them.</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Complain to the heads of your county. Maybe you can convince them to do something, and if you have a problem you want us to solve, a COVID question we can answer, get in touch with us. We will do our best to help you out.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you don&#8217;t get something, you don&#8217;t pay for it, right? Well, not during a pandemic and not on college campuses. That has students asking about pricey fees for things they can&#8217;t get. It&#8217;s tonight&#8217;s Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>Louis and Melanie are brother and sister, both are Florida International University students and because of COVID-19, both are taking classes online from their home.</p>
<p>Louis Correa, upset at college fees: &#8220;I&#8217;m going for my bachelor&#8217;s in science and biology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Melanie Correa, taking classes online: &#8220;I&#8217;m actually a senior. This is my last semester.&#8221;</p>
<p>College is expensive, and the Correas believe their online learning is more expensive than it should be.</p>
<p>Melanie Correa: &#8220;I think they&#8217;re overcharging us for things that we&#8217;re not using.&#8221;</p>
<p>Louis Correa: &#8220;Like, for spring, my course fees were $25, and now it&#8217;s $200.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even though they are learning from home, they have to pay a parking fee.</p>
<p>Melanie Correa: &#8220;We&#8217;re not parking our cars over there. I don&#8217;t understand why we&#8217;re being charged for transportation fee or garage fee.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is an athletic fee, even though all athletic programs have been shut down, and Louis pays several lab fees.</p>
<p>Louis Correa: &#8220;You have to pay for being in the lab, which, to me, that&#8217;s completely pointless because we&#8217;re not using any of the stuff. We&#8217;ll be all online, everything&#8217;s distance learning.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is a fee for taking classes online called distance learning.</p>
<p>There is an activity fee, even though there are no activities for the Correas on campus. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Melanie Correa: &#8220;I think that it should be stopped. We shouldn&#8217;t have to be overcharged, especially what&#8217;s going on now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Louis says he contacted school officials about the eight fees he is paying.</p>
<p>Louis Correa: &#8220;They say that there&#8217;s a shortfall in revenue because they&#8217;re not getting money back from the rentals on campus and food that they sell on campus, so they&#8217;re looking for a balance.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, do students have to pay for things they cannot get or cannot use, Howard?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7 News Legal Expert: &#8220;Yes, while there is no law written to regulate expenses during a pandemic, a college or university can charge fees for fixed expenses. In other words, charge fees to cover loans they have taken out to build a garage or buy lab equipment or build a basketball court.&#8221;</p>
<p>While we are on colleges, a University of Florida student is having to pay for a dorm in Gainesville, even though he is living in South Florida taking his classes online. Is that legal?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;If the dorm is opened and the student chooses to stay home, they have to pay for the dorm they signed up for, but if the dorm is shut down due to the pandemic, then the student does not have to pay for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>When a Miami restaurant closed, they told their chef, &#8220;Don&#8217;t take another job. When we reopen, you will still be our chef.&#8221; They recently reopened and told him, &#8220;Nevermind, we hired someone else.&#8221; Is that promise binding?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Since Florida is an at-will state, meaning you can be fired for no reason at all, the courts will not give you money for a broken promise. In other words, they don&#8217;t have to hire him back, even though they promised to. Next time, if they make a promise, get it in writing, and then, you can go after them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Louis Correa: &#8220;At least reduce it to the point where the students can pay for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Louis is not giving up, and the young student has started a petition to get the school to drop the fees they&#8217;re charging all the students.</p>
<p>Louis Correa: &#8220;I want the fees to go down for everybody. It&#8217;s not fair at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, if you want to sign Louis&#8217; petition to FIU, and if you want to see how the school explains the reasoning for many of the fees they are charging students, the links to both are down below.</p>
<p>If you have a problem you cannot resolve, a COVID question you want to get answered for free, get in touch with us. We are here for you.</p>

<p>Thank you for reaching out. We do not discuss individual students&#8217; situation but I can tell you that fees have not increased. Here is an explanation of fees, per your request:</p>
<p>At FIU, we understand that some of our students and their families have questions about fees. We hope the explanations below help answer your questions related to fees, which fund important services at the university.</p>
<p><strong>Distance Learning fee:</strong> There is no Distance Learning fee associated with classes being taught remotely because of the pandemic. These classes were designed originally to be taught face-to-face and are now being delivered remotely to allow students to continue their studies from home. Many of the remote classes still have students and faculty meeting via videoconferencing on specific days and times.</p>
<p>A Distance Learning fee of $30 per credit is assessed only for online courses, which are courses that are designed and developed specifically to be delivered online. Faculty designing the courses leverage dedicated online instructional designers and educational technologies reserved for fully online courses. Students access the course 24/7. The Distance Learning fee funds the infrastructure and team that helps deliver these courses.</p>
<p><strong>Parking fee:</strong> The parking fee helps pay for the garages, which cannot be built using state dollars, and covers the debt payments on the garages as well as costs associated with operations, maintenance and repairs.</p>
<p><strong>Student Health fee:</strong> These funds pay for several services that have remained open, continue to assist students remotely and provided virtual engagement opportunities such as Student Health Clinic, Counseling and Psychological Services, Victim Empowerment Program, Disability Resource Center, and Healthy Living Program. If you need assistance, please call for an appointment.<br />
For a Telehealth appointment please call 305-348-8385 for MMC and 305-919-5620 for BBC. For the safety and welfare of all, please call ahead. The on-campus pharmacy is also open. Please call 305-348-0276 to refill or transfer your prescription.</p>
<p><strong>Athletics fee:</strong> Even though all athletic programs have been suspended temporarily in accordance with NCAA rules, there are significant fixed costs associated with the athletics program, including student-athlete scholarships, staffing, operations and maintenance of our sports facilities, including the FIU Football Stadium which was constructed with proceeds from the issuance of bonds that must be repaid. We are hopeful that intercollegiate athletic competitions will resume later this fall as soon as conditions allow it.</p>
<p><strong>Activity fee:</strong> This fee supports the Graham and Wolfe centers, and Wellness and Recreation Centers and funds student organizations, campus life and helps pay costs that the university is required to pay even though students are learning remotely. During this time, programing such as virtual fitness classes, Life Skills Series, Club Fair, Greek Information Sessions and special speakers are facilitated through this fee. The Wellness and Recreation centers will be open this fall, with physical distancing and other measures in place.</p>
<p><strong>Materials and Supplies/Equipment Use fees:</strong> For Fall 2020 courses that require materials and supplies, the fee will be charged. Supplies will be made available to the students for those courses that are remote and require the supplies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most people know that if a family member is in the hospital with the coronavirus, you can&#8217;t visit, but after one family member died of COVID, his family wasn&#8217;t allowed to see his body to confirm the right person was going into his casket. Is that legal? It&#8217;s why they called Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>Nothing can be worse than death, but for Francisco Chirino&#8217;s family, it did get worse.</p>
<p>Cindy Sanchez, Francisco&#8217;s granddaughter: &#8220;We were never able to see my grandfather while he was in the hospital because of the COVID situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Francisco was sent to the hospital where they determined the 87-year-old had the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Lazaro Chirino, Francisco&#8217;s son: &#8220;Then, what, 24 hours later, they called us, and they said that he&#8217;s dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>After Francisco passed away, Cindy asked to see her beloved grandfather&#8217;s body to confirm he was dead.</p>
<p>The hospital and funeral home both said no.</p>
<p>Cindy Sanchez: &#8220;Could I not see my grandfather for just one minute, or someone in my family, to identify that we&#8217;re not putting some unidentified person into a crypt? We have no idea who is going into that box.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since Francisco had prepaid for the burial, Cindy asked the funeral home to let a family member step in for one second when they embalmed his body to confirm it was him.</p>
<p>She got more distressing news.</p>
<p>Cindy Sanchez: &#8220;This funeral director told me that he will not be embalmed.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the mausoleum found out the funeral home was not embalming COVID victims, they delivered another blow.</p>
<p>Lazaro Chirino: &#8220;The cemetery is basically telling us they will not place him in the mausoleum if he&#8217;s not embalmed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cindy was then told the person who was transporting the body from the hospital to the funeral home offered to open the body bag and snap a picture of Francisco&#8217;s face &#8230; for $300.</p>
<p>Lazaro Chirino: &#8220;You&#8217;ll die for $300, but you won&#8217;t let us identify the body? It really makes no sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Deaths are a nightmare. This nightmare just won&#8217;t end.</p>
<p>Cindy Sanchez: &#8220;They need to let me see the body so I can identify my grandfather is in the casket.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lazaro Chirino: &#8220;Why can&#8217;t we see him? He&#8217;s not breathing, he&#8217;s not sneezing, and he&#8217;s not coughing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Do you have a right to see a family member who has passed away from the coronavirus? Howard?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7News legal expert: &#8220;Yes, you do. No matter what the person dies from, Florida law gives the next of kin, which is called the legally authorized person, the right to possess the body, and that includes seeing it, but not at the hospital. You have to wait until the body is transported to the funeral home or medical examiner&#8217;s office to view them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Howard, some more questions. An association is requiring residents to give 48 hours notice if a visitor is coming. Can they do that?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;A board can adopt rules that are well-defined and clear, but this is too broad. It does not provide for emergencies, and I do not believe this is legal.&#8221;</p>
<p>He works in the kitchen at a fast food restaurant and has heart disease and diabetes. An employee got COVID, and the owner didn&#8217;t tell them. Do they have to disclose that?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;They cannot tell you who tested positive, but they have to tell you someone you work with did. If they don&#8217;t, they are violating federal requirements, and you can file a complaint with OSHA. The link is at wsvn.com under this Help Me Howard story.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cindy Sanchez: &#8220;We want closure.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Cindy got it. The funeral director told me they stopped embalming COVID victims after one of her employees became infected with coronavirus and died.</p>
<p>Cindy then contacted another funeral home who agreed to embalm Francisco and take a picture for free to confirm for the family it was Francisco.</p>
<p>Francisco was then laid to rest a few days later inside the mausoleum he had paid for. The family nightmare has ended.</p>
<p>Cindy Sanchez: &#8220;We want to make sure that no other families goes through what we&#8217;re going through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lazaro Chirino: &#8220;We do understand the issue of the pandemic and the coronavirus and all of that, but I think it&#8217;s unjust.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just when you think you&#8217;ve heard every COVID problem, another one pops up. They just never seem to end.</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;And if you have problems with the coronavirus or questions you need answered, give us a call. We are here for you.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the coronavirus crushed the economy, the federal government handed out billions to keep businesses afloat, and now, one South Florida contractor who got money is being told he has 10 days to repay it. Answers to his questions and others on tonight&#8217;s Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>When the coronavirus swarmed in, almost everyone got slapped in the wallet. Some worse than others.</p>
<p>Eric Scarborough, EJD Construction Contractors: “When COVID started around March, we lost about $904,000 in new construction sales, so it really scared the crap out of me.”</p>
<p>Eric is a general contractor.</p>
<p>Eric Scarborough: “And I do home remodeling kitchens and baths and things like that, major home remodels.”</p>
<p>But as the virus crushed businesses, the federal government offered loans and grants to keep companies operating.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump: &#8220;We&#8217;ve now processed over $200 billion to small businesses to help retain their workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eric applied for a $300,000 loan.</p>
<p>Eric Scarborough: &#8220;I fill out the PPP loan, but because now it became two parts &#8212; the PPP loan and the EIDL loan, which is the grant.&#8221;</p>
<p>It sounds confusing, but while Eric didn&#8217;t get what he asked for, he did receive $24,000 and said he spent it the way he was supposed to spend it.</p>
<p>Eric Scarborough: “I use it for payroll, everything for employees. That money&#8217;s gone.”</p>
<p>Then, Eric got a letter from Bank of America.</p>
<p>Eric Scarborough: “So, in the letter, it said that I had to pay back that $10,000 and I had 10 days to do it.”</p>
<p>Ten days to return the $10,000 that Eric had already spent on his employees.</p>
<p>Eric then tried to straighten it out with the government and the bank.</p>
<p>Eric Scarborough: “And the SBA says, ‘No, that money is supposed to be eligible to you. You need to talk to Bank of America.’ I call Bank of America, and they say, ‘No, you have to talk to SBA.’&#8221;</p>
<p>A mess as a small businessman trying to survive gets sucked into the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Eric Scarborough: “Someone made a mistake, and it wasn&#8217;t me, but I&#8217;m paying the consequences.”</p>
<p>Can a business be forced to return the money they got when the coronavirus hit, Howard?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7 News Legal Expert: “If the government can prove a mistake was made, even if it was by the government or the bank, they can force Eric to return the money.”</p>
<p>And if Eric doesn&#8217;t have the $10,000 to return within 10 days, then what?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: “You cannot get blood from a turnip, as they say. If he can’t pay and they cannot work something out, the bank will have to take him to court when the courts reopen, eventually.”</p>
<p>Some other questions: a woman rents a room at a private home and has tested positive for the coronavirus. The landlord wants to throw her out. Can they?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: “Right now there is a ban on evictions, and even if evictions were legal, you can&#8217;t throw someone out for being sick.”</p>
<p>A renter emailed that they are being charged a $100 COVID cleaning fee when they move out of their apartment. Is that legal?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: “If it was not in the lease, no. You cannot charge a COVID cleaning fee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eric Scarborough: “You guys did a lot.”</p>
<p>Good news for Eric. After we exchanged nearly 20 emails with Bank of America and the Small Business Administration, the bank agreed to lower the amount Eric owes from $10,000 to $5,000, and that big federal loan is now back on track, which would also help Eric pay back the $5,000.</p>
<p>Eric Scarborough: “Since you got involved, I now have an application that is being fast-tracked, so I should be getting a low-interest loan, which is good that I applied for anyways.”</p>
<p>The man knows how to build homes, but weaving your way through banks and the bureaucracy is a whole different hurdle for everyone.</p>
<p>Got a problem you cannot solve? A COVID question you need answered? Let us know. We would truly love to help you out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A husband and wife are trying to keep their restaurant going as they work seven days a week, 14 hours a day during the coronavirus pandemic. If that wasn&#8217;t tough enough, an inspector walked in and made a demand they could not believe. What was it? Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser tells us.</p>
<p>You almost have to be a workaholic to own a successful restaurant.</p>
<p>Katia Roque, Munchies Cafe: &#8220;It is my husband and I. We run it ourselves. We&#8217;re here every day. We open at 5:30 in the morning, and we close at 7 p.m.&#8221;</p>
<p>Katia and Eddie have owned Munchies Cafe on Bird Road for 17 years, and despite the seven-day-a-week, 14-hour days, they like it.</p>
<p>Katia Roque: &#8220;Our employees are great, and we love our business. We have very loyal customers that have helped us out through these very difficult moments.&#8221;</p>
<p>The virus moments, now virus months, now hitting their cash register as hard as it&#8217;s hit the country&#8217;s health.</p>
<p>Katia Roque: &#8220;Maybe half of what we were making. It&#8217;s very difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>With indoor dining banned, Katia has relied on her <em>ventanita</em>, or takeout window, and three tables outside.</p>
<p>Plus, she left one table with two chairs inside for employees to sit and take a break or for her to pay the bills.</p>
<p>And then&#8230;</p>
<p>Katia Roque: &#8220;The inspector came in. I stood up, I told her we were the owners, and she said, &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry. It is not allowed. You must take the table outside right now.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Katia tried to explain to the Miami-Dade inspector that the table was not for customers but for her and employees.</p>
<p>Katia Roque: &#8220;Can we have this table? Can my employees take their break there? Can the owners sit? These are non-paying customers.'&#8221;</p>
<p>The county inspector said, &#8220;No. Get the table outside immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>Katia Roque: &#8220;She simply said, &#8216;Listen, I&#8217;m doing my job. Don&#8217;t argue with me, and I have to give you the warning.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe it was the six months of their income cut in half. Maybe it was the seven-day-a-week, 14-hour grind to try to save their business, but after being told she could not sit at this table in her own restaurant, Katia had enough.</p>
<p>Katia Roque: &#8220;We lost it. We told her how difficult things are, how hard we&#8217;re working, how it&#8217;s one table to sit down for 10 minutes a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The county inspector would not budge, and Katia gave up.</p>
<p>Katia Roque: &#8220;There was nothing else I could say, because then we&#8217;re afraid that they&#8217;ll give you a fine, they&#8217;ll shut you down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Katia can&#8217;t sit at a small table to rest inside her own restaurant. The inspector thinks they are doing what the county order requires.</p>
<p>Or does it, Howard?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7News legal expert: &#8220;No, it doesn&#8217;t, and this is ridiculous, because the county law is targeting customers. Of course the owner and their employees can sit and rest or eat at an indoor table.&#8221;</p>
<p>We are getting a lot of mask questions. This one: can you be fired for complaining about a fellow employee not wearing a mask or not wearing it properly?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;No, you cannot. You are protected under federal law. If you are fired, file a complaint with OSHA. The link is under this Help Me Howard story.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you have the coronavirus, can your association force you to stay in your home and fine you if you come outside?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;They cannot keep you in your condo, but they can keep you out of the common areas like the pool or clubhouse. However, they do have to let you walk through the common area to get in and out of your condo as long as you wear a mask. If you do that, they cannot fine you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Katia Roque: &#8220;I love to help my customers. I love to see them leave happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miami-Dade County admitted their inspector was wrong, writing, &#8220;Employees can use the indoor table for work breaks and meals.&#8221;</p>
<p>One less headache for Katia as she battles to keep Munchies Cafe alive.</p>
<p>Katia Roque: &#8220;Most of all, we do it for our employees. We don&#8217;t want to see them go home. We all have bills. We all have families.&#8221;</p>
<p>You just have to feel horrible for so many small business owners struggling to survive and understand the constantly changing rules.</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;And you have to feel bad for the city and county inspectors, because some of the rules they are told to enforce are confusing and not clear at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Someone cooked up a problem that&#8217;s got you in a hot spot? Take it off the back burner and dish it up for us. Hopefully we can set the table for a solution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A massage parlor can open. A gym can open, but an arcade cannot open. It&#8217;s another case of closure confusion. Plus, do poll workers have to disinfect after each voter? Those questions and more in tonight&#8217;s Help Me Howard with Patrick Fraser.</p>
<p>Before video games, pinball machines were the rage, and arcades were a place to play. Key word: were.</p>
<p>Rick Medina, Arcade Odyssey: &#8220;We&#8217;ve been called the last real arcade in South Florida.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rick Medina owns Arcade Odyssey in Kendall.</p>
<p>Rick Medina: &#8220;We went ahead, and we created this place to basically give teenagers and young adults a place to go and to enjoy themselves inexpensively.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lots of fun until the coronavirus hit, and Miami-Dade County bumped him out of business.</p>
<p>Rick Medina: &#8220;That basically stipulates that all arcades must remain closed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, the machines are silent, baffling Rick since many similar businesses have been allowed to reopen.</p>
<p>Rick Medina: &#8220;I believe gyms can be riskier, barber shops, massage parlors, tattoo shops. How am I riskier than these other businesses? That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m asking. Just give me that answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rick has 130 machines spread out over 4,000 square feet. He says he can easily put a dozen customers 10 feet apart, and he tried to explain that to county officials.</p>
<p>Rick Medina: &#8220;I&#8217;ve been calling the mayor&#8217;s office almost every day, sending emails, reaching out to my commissioners, and they all tell me the same thing, &#8216;Rick, we don&#8217;t have an answer for you. We don&#8217;t know why you are closed.'&#8221;</p>
<p>And Rick argues months after the virus hit, it&#8217;s clear to him the county&#8217;s reason for shutting businesses like his has not worked.</p>
<p>Rick Medina: &#8220;If closing small businesses was going to make such a deep impact, don&#8217;t you think after four months of small businesses being closed, the numbers would have gone down a little bit, not climbed astronomically?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rick sees no hope on the horizon, so Howard, can the county continue to target certain business owners who disagree with the county&#8217;s logic for closing them down?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein, 7 News Legal Expert: &#8220;Even if Rick thinks it makes no sense to open a massage parlor and a gym but close an arcade and a bowling alley, the government has the power to do that during an emergency. The only solution: Rick could get together with owners of similar non-essential businesses and ask a judge to overrule the county and let them reopen.&#8221;</p>
<p>A restaurant owner who went out of business asked us if he has the right to go back in and take his equipment out.</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;In a commercial lease, if you owe money, the landlord can keep the equipment, and if you try to take your own equipment, it could actually be a crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>A viewer emailed and said he has the coronavirus and wants to take hydroxychloroquine, which President Trump has touted, but his doctor won&#8217;t prescribe it. Can a physician refuse?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;Absolutely. It requires a prescription, and if a doctor doesn&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s appropriate, they can refuse to prescribe it, but if a physician thinks it will work, they can prescribe it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Early voting for the August election started in Miami-Dade and starts soon in Broward. A viewer who voted said they were not disinfecting the booths and pens after every voter. What are the requirements?</p>
<p>Howard Finkelstein: &#8220;It&#8217;s up to the county. For example, in Miami-Dade, they told us they let the poll workers decide whether to disinfect after every voter or every hour, and remember, you can bring you own pen to fill out your ballot. Just make sure it&#8217;s blue or black ink.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for why Rick&#8217;s arcade is closed and massage parlors and gyms are opened, the spokesperson wrote, &#8220;be assured that Mayor Gimenez makes all decisions based on the research and expert opinions of his team of doctors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rick&#8217;s response: The only thing that can be assured, many more businesses are going to be gone forever.</p>
<p>Rick Medina: &#8220;It&#8217;s just going to put everyone out of business and get us all on welfare really, really quick, and that&#8217;s what we are seeing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rick says he is going to hire an attorney to try to get a judge to reopen his arcade.</p>
<p>Got a COVID problem you can&#8217;t figure out or a question you need answered? Get in touch with us. You are why we are here.</p>
