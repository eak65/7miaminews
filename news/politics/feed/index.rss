										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK (AP) — The two top Democrats in New York’s legislature withdrew their support for Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday amid mounting allegations of sexual harassment and undercounting COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins became the first senior Democrat in the state to say the three-term governor should resign. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie stopped short of demanding that Cuomo quit, but said in a statement that “it is time for the Governor to seriously consider whether he can effectively meet the needs of the people of New York.”</p>
<p>On Saturday, two more women who worked for Cuomo publicly accused him of inappropriate behavior, on the heels of other allegations in recent weeks.</p>
<p>“Every day there is another account that is drawing away from the business of government,” Stewart-Cousins said in a statement. “New York is still in the midst of this pandemic and is still facing the societal, health and economic impacts of it. We need to govern without daily distraction. For the good of the state Governor Cuomo must resign.”</p>
<p>Her public push for his resignation came shortly after a Sunday press conference where Cuomo said it would be “anti-democratic” for him to step down.</p>
<p>“There is no way I resign,” Cuomo told reporters.</p>
<p>“They don’t override the people&#8217;s will, they don’t get to override elections,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was elected by the people of New York state. I wasn’t elected by politicians.”</p>
<p>In a brief phone conversation Sunday prior to the press conference, Cuomo told Stewart-Cousins he wouldn’t quit and they would have to impeach him if they wanted him out of office, according to a person who was briefed by someone on the call. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the call was intended to be private.</p>
<p>Cuomo said the next six months will determine how successfully New York emerges from the coronavirus pandemic. “I’m not going to be distracted because there is too much to do for the people,” he said, noting that the state must pass a budget within three weeks and administer 15 million more COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>Support for Cuomo has eroded with surprising speed as he&#8217;s faced twin scandals, one over his treatment of women in the workplace, and a second over his administration&#8217;s months-long refusal to release complete statistics on COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes.</p>
<p>Some lawmakers have been infuriated by revelations that Cuomo&#8217;s administration delayed releasing some data about deaths of nursing home patients in hospitals, at least partly because of concerns it could be used against them by President Donald Trump&#8217;s administration.</p>
<p>Several women have publicly told of feeling sexually harassed, or at least made to feel demeaned and uncomfortable. The state’s attorney general is investigating. Cuomo has urged people to wait for that investigation to conclude before they judge him.</p>
<p>Others who have called for Cuomo&#8217;s resignation include U.S. Rep. Kathleen Rice, a Long Island Democrat.</p>
<p>Former adviser Lindsey Boylan, 36, said Cuomo made inappropriate comments on her appearance, joked about playing strip poker and once kissed her on the lips at the end of a meeting. Former aide, 25-year-old Charlotte Bennett, said Cuomo asked if she ever had sex with older men and made other comments she interpreted as gauging her interest in an affair.</p>
<p>Another former aide, Ana Liss, told The Wall Street Journal in a story published Saturday that when she worked as a policy aide to the governor between 2013 and 2015, Cuomo called her “sweetheart,” kissed her hand and asked personal questions including whether she had a boyfriend.</p>
<p>Asked about Liss&#8217; story at his news conference Sunday, Cuomo said such talk was “my way of doing friendly banter.”</p>
<p>Echoing comments he made in a news conference last week, Cuomo acknowledged he’d made jokes and asked personal questions in an attempt to be collegial and frequently greeted people with hugs and kisses.</p>
<p>“I never meant to make anyone feel any uncomfortable,&#8221; he said. Cuomo has denied touching anyone inappropriately.</p>
<p>While Cuomo has been apologetic in recent days over his behavior, at least tacitly acknowledging that some of the things women have said are true, he&#8217;s also singled out a few accusations as flatly false.</p>
<p>On Sunday he disputed a story told by about him by Karen Hinton, a former press aide to Cuomo when he served as the federal housing secretary under President Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>In a story published Saturday in The Washington Post, Hinton detailed an uncomfortable hotel room interaction she had with Cuomo when the two met in California years ago as they were trying to patch things up after an estrangement.</p>
<p>Hinton said that as she got up to leave, Cuomo gave her a hug that was “very long, too long, too tight, too intimate.”</p>
<p>She described the encounter not as sexual harassment but as a “power play” for “manipulation and control.” She was no longer an aide to Cuomo at the time.</p>
<p>Asked Sunday about Hinton’s account Cuomo said it was “not true” and noted that the two had been longtime political adversaries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(AP) — Republican state lawmakers are pushing for social media giants to face costly lawsuits for policing content on their websites, taking aim at a federal law that prevents internet companies from being sued for removing posts.</p>
<p>GOP politicians in roughly two dozen states have introduced bills that would allow for civil lawsuits against platforms for what they call the “censorship” of posts. Many protest the deletion of political and religious statements, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Democrats, who also have called for greater scrutiny of big tech, are sponsoring the same measures in at least two states.</p>
<p>The federal liability shield has long been a target of former President Donald Trump and other Republicans, whose complaints about Silicon Valley stifling conservative viewpoints were amplified when the companies cracked down on misleading posts about the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Twitter and Facebook, which are often criticized for opaque policing policies, took the additional step of silencing Trump on their platforms after the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Twitter has banned him, while a semi-independent panel is reviewing Facebook&#8217;s indefinite suspension of his account and considering whether to reinstate access.</p>
<p>Experts argue the legislative proposals are doomed to fail while the federal law, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/d3e09c4037e2fc17558492b9bdce1ecc">Section 230</a> of the Communications Decency Act, is in place. They said state lawmakers are wading into unconstitutional territory by trying to interfere with the editorial policies of private companies.</p>
<p>Len Niehoff, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, described the idea as a “constitutional non-starter.”</p>
<p>“If an online platform wants to have a policy that it will delete certain kinds of tweets, delete certain kinds of users, forbid certain kinds of content, that is in the exercise of their right as an information distributer,&#8221; he said. “And the idea that you would create a cause of action that would allow people to sue when that happens is deeply problematic under the First Amendment.”</p>
<p>The bills vary slightly but many allow for civil lawsuits if a social media user is censored over posts having to do with politics or religion, with some proposals allowing for damages of $75,000 for each blocked post. They would apply to companies with millions of users and carve out exemptions for posts that call for violence, entice criminal acts or other similar conduct.</p>
<p>The sponsor of Oklahoma&#8217;s version, Republican state Sen. Rob Standridge, said social media posts are being unjustly censored and that people should have a way to challenge the platforms&#8217; actions given their powerful place in American discourse. His bill passed committee in late February on a 5-3 vote, with Democrats opposed.</p>
<p>“This just gives citizens recourse,” he said, adding that the companies “can&#8217;t abuse that immunity” given to them through federal law.</p>
<p>Part of a broad, 1996 federal law on telecoms, <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:47%20section:230%20edition:prelim)">Section 230</a> generally exempts internet companies from being sued over what users post on their sites. The statute, which was meant to promote the growth of the internet, exempts websites from being sued for removing content deemed to be “obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable&#8221; as long as the companies are acting in “good faith.”</p>
<p>As the power of social media has grown, so has the prospect of government regulation. Several congressional hearings have been held on content moderation, sometimes with Silicon Valley CEOs called to testify. Republicans, and some Democrats, have argued that the companies should lose their liability shield or that Section 230 should be updated to make the companies meet certain criteria before receiving legal protection.</p>
<p>Twitter and Facebook also have been hounded over what critics have described as sluggish, after-the-fact account suspensions or post takedowns, with liberals complaining they have given too much latitude to conservatives and hate groups.</p>
<p>Trump railed against Section 230 throughout his term in office, well before Twitter and Facebook blocked his access to their platforms after the assault on the Capitol. Last May, he signed a largely symbolic <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fc30f9ebdff9d3d33a870e7374f8ffa6">executive order</a> that directed the executive branch to ask independent rule-making agencies whether new regulations could be placed on the companies.</p>
<p>“All of these tech monopolies are going to abuse their power and interfere in our elections, and it has to be stopped,” <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-capitol-siege-media-e79eb5164613d6718e9f4502eb471f27">he told supporters</a> at the Capitol hours before the riot.</p>
<p>Antigone Davis, global head of safety for Facebook, said these kinds of proposals would make it harder for the site to remove posts involving hate speech, sexualized photos of minors and other harmful content.</p>
<p>“We will continue advocating for updated rules for the internet, including reforms to federal law that protect free expression while allowing platforms like ours to remove content that threatens the safety and security of people across the United States,” she said.</p>
<p>In a statement, Twitter said: “We enforce the Twitter rules judiciously and impartially for everyone on our service – regardless of ideology or political affiliation – and our policies help us to protect the diversity and health of the public conversation.”</p>
<p>Researchers have not found widespread evidence that social media companies are biased against conservative news, posts or materials.</p>
<p>In a February <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b6df958f8370af3217d4178/t/60187b5f45762e708708c8e9/1612217185240/NYU+False+Accusation_2.pdf">report, </a>New York University&#8217;s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights called the accusations political disinformation spread by Republicans. The report recommended that social media sites give clear reasoning when they take action against material on their platforms.</p>
<p>“Greater transparency — such as that which Twitter and Facebook offered when they took action against President Trump in January — would help to defuse claims of political bias, while clarifying the boundaries of acceptable user conduct,” the report read.</p>
<p>While the federal law is in place, the state proposals mostly amount to political posturing, said Darrell West, vice president of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, a public policy group.</p>
<p>“This is red meat for the base. It&#8217;s a way to show conservatives they don&#8217;t like being pushed around,” he said. “They&#8217;ve seen Trump get kicked off Facebook and Twitter, and so this is a way to tell Republican voters this is unfair and Republicans are fighting for them.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) &#xE2;&#x80;&#x94; A new&#xC2;&#xA0;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/07/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-to-promote-voting-access/">executive order</a>&#xC2;&#xA0;from President Joe Biden directs federal agencies to take a series of steps to promote voting access, a move that comes as congressional Democrats press for a&#xC2;&#xA0;sweeping voting and elections bill&#xC2;&#xA0;to counter efforts to&#xC2;&#xA0;restrict voting access.<p>His plan was announced during a&#xC2;&#xA0;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/03/07/pre-taped-remarks-by-president-biden-as-prepared-for-delivery-at-the-martin-coretta-scott-king-unity-breakfast/">recorded address</a>&#xC2;&#xA0;on the 56th commemoration of &#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;Bloody Sunday,&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D; the 1965 incident in which some 600 civil rights activists were viciously beaten by state troopers as they tried to march for voting rights in Selma, Alabama.</p><p>&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;Every eligible voter should be able to vote and have it counted,&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D; Biden said in his remarks to Sunday&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;s Martin and Coretta King Unity Breakfast before signing the order. &#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;If you have the best ideas, you have nothing to hide. Let the people vote.&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D;</p><div><embed type="oembed">https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1368611436516245506?s=20</embed></div><p>Biden&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;s order includes several modest provisions. It directs federal agencies to expand access to voter registration and election information, calls on the heads of agencies to come up with plans to give federal employees time off to vote or volunteer as nonpartisan poll workers, and pushes an overhaul of the government&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;s Vote.gov website.</p><p>Democrats are attempting to solidify support for House Resolution 1, which touches on virtually every aspect of the electoral process. It was approved Wednesday on a near party-line vote, 220-210.</p><p>The voting rights bill includes provisions to restrict partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts, strike down hurdles to voting and bring transparency to a murky campaign finance system that allows wealthy donors to anonymously bankroll political causes.</p><p>Democrats say the bill will help stifle voter suppression attempts, while Republicans have cast the bill as unwanted federal interference in states&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99; authority to conduct their own elections.</p><p>The bill&#x2019;s fate is far from certain in the closely divided Senate. Conservative groups have undertaken a $5 million campaign to try persuade moderate Senate Democrats to oppose rule changes needed to pass the measure.</p><p>With his executive order, Biden is looking to turn the spotlight on the issue and is using the somber commemoration of Bloody Sunday to make the case that much is at stake.</p><p>Bloody Sunday proved to be a turning point in the civil rights movement that led to passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Similarly, Biden is hoping the Jan. 6 sacking of the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Donald Trump mob will prove to be a clarion call for Congress to take action to improve voter protections.</p><p>&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;In 2020 &#xE2;&#x80;&#x94; with our very democracy on the line &#xE2;&#x80;&#x94; even in the midst of a pandemic &#xE2;&#x80;&#x93; more Americans voted than ever before,&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D; Biden said. &#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;Yet instead of celebrating this powerful demonstration of voting &#xE2;&#x80;&#x94; we saw an unprecedented insurrection on our Capitol and a brutal attack on our democracy on January 6th. A never-before-seen effort to ignore, undermine and undo the will of the people.&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D;</p><p>Biden&#x2019;s also paid tribute to the late civil rights giants Rev. C.T. Vivian, Rev. Joseph Lowery and Rep. John Lewis. All played critical roles in the 1965 organizing efforts in Selma and all died in within the past year.</p></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — An exhausted Senate narrowly approved a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill Saturday as President Joe Biden and his Democratic allies notched a victory they called crucial for hoisting the country out of the pandemic and economic doldrums.</p>
<p>After laboring all night on a mountain of amendments — nearly all from Republicans and rejected — bleary-eyed senators approved the sprawling package on a 50-49 party-line vote. That sets up final congressional approval by the House next week so lawmakers can whisk it to Biden for his signature.</p>
<p>The huge measure — its cost is nearly one-tenth the size of the entire U.S. economy — is Biden’s biggest early priority. It stands as his formula for addressing the deadly virus and a limping economy, twin crises that have afflicted the country for a year.</p>
<p>“This nation has suffered too much for much too long,” Biden told reporters at the White House after the vote. “And everything in this package is designed to relieve the suffering and to meet the most urgent needs of the nation, and put us in a better position to prevail.”</p>
<p>Saturday&#8217;s vote was also a crucial political moment for Biden and Democrats, who need nothing short of party unanimity in a 50-50 Senate they run with Vice President Kamala Harris&#8217; tiebreaking vote. They hold a slim 10-vote House edge.</p>
<p>Not one Republican backed the bill in the Senate or when it initially passed the House, underscoring the barbed partisan environment that&#8217;s characterized the early days of Biden&#8217;s presidency.</p>
<p>A small but pivotal band of moderate Democrats leveraged changes in the legislation that incensed progressives, hardly helping Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., guide the measure through the House. But rejection of their first, signature bill was not an option for Democrats, who face two years of running Congress with virtually no room for error.</p>
<p>In a significant sign, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, representing around 100 House liberals, called the Senate&#8217;s weakening of some provisions “bad policy and bad politics” but “relatively minor concessions.” Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said the bill retained its “core bold, progressive elements.”</p>
<p>“They feel like we do, we have to get this done,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said of the House. He added, “It&#8217;s not going to be everything everyone wants. No bill is.”</p>
<p>In a written statement, Pelosi invited Republicans &#8220;to join us in recognition of the devastating reality of this vicious virus and economic crisis and of the need for decisive action.”</p>
<p>The bill provides direct payments of up to $1,400 for most Americans and extended emergency unemployment benefits. There are vast piles of spending for COVID-19 vaccines and testing, states and cities, schools and ailing industries, along with tax breaks to help lower-earning people, families with children and consumers buying health insurance.</p>
<p>Republicans call the measure a wasteful spending spree for Democrats’ liberal allies that ignores recent indications that the pandemic and economy was turning the corner.</p>
<p>“The Senate has never spent $2 trillion in a more haphazard way,&#8221; said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. He said Democrats&#8217; “top priority wasn&#8217;t pandemic relief. It was their Washington wish list.”</p>
<p>The Senate commenced a dreaded “vote-a-rama” — a continuous series of votes on amendments — shortly before midnight Friday, and by its end around noon dispensed with about three dozen. The Senate had been in session since 9 a.m. EST Friday.</p>
<p>Overnight, the chamber looked like an experiment in sleep deprivation. Several lawmakers appeared to rest their eyes or doze at their desks, often burying their faces in their hands. At one point, Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, at 48 one of the younger senators, trotted into the chamber and did a prolonged stretch.</p>
<p>Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, missed the votes to attend his father-in-law’s funeral.</p>
<p>The measure follows five earlier ones totaling about $4 trillion enacted since last spring and comes amid signs of a potential turnaround.</p>
<p>Vaccine supplies are growing, deaths and caseloads have eased but remain frighteningly high, and hiring was surprisingly strong last month, though the economy remains 10 million jobs smaller than pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>The Senate package was delayed repeatedly as Democrats made eleventh-hour changes aimed at balancing demands by their competing moderate and progressive factions.</p>
<p>Work on the bill ground to a halt Friday after an agreement among Democrats on extending emergency jobless benefits seemed to collapse. Nearly 12 hours later, top Democrats and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, perhaps the chamber&#8217;s most conservative Democrat, said they had a deal, and the Senate approved it on a party-line 50-49 vote.</p>
<p>Under their compromise, $300 weekly emergency unemployment checks — on top of regular state benefits — would be renewed, with a final payment Sept. 6. There would also be tax breaks on some of that aid, helping people the pandemic abruptly tossed out of jobs and risked tax penalties on the benefits.</p>
<p>The House relief bill, largely similar to the Senate&#8217;s, provided $400 weekly benefits through August. The current $300 per week payments expire March 14, and Democrats want the bill on Biden&#8217;s desk by then to avert a lapse.</p>
<p>Manchin and Republicans have asserted that higher jobless benefits discourage people from returning to work, a rationale most Democrats and many economists reject.</p>
<p>The agreement on jobless benefits wasn&#8217;t the only move that showed moderates&#8217; sway.</p>
<p>The Senate voted Friday to eject a House-approved boost in the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025, a major defeat for progressives. Eight Democrats opposed the increase, suggesting that Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and other liberals pledging to continue the effort will face a difficult fight.</p>
<p>Party leaders also agreed to restrict eligibility for the $1,400 stimulus checks for most Americans. That amount would be gradually reduced until, under the Senate bill, it reaches zero for people earning $80,000 and couples making $160,000. Those ceilings were higher in the House version.</p>
<p>Many of the rejected GOP amendments were either attempts to force Democrats to cast politically awkward votes or for Republicans to demonstrate their zeal for issues that appeal to their voters.</p>
<p>These included defeated efforts to bar funds from going to schools that don&#8217;t reopen their doors or let transgender students born male participate in female sports. One amendment would have blocked aid to so-called sanctuary cities, where local authorities don&#8217;t help federal officials round up immigrants in the U.S. illegally.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans have one goal for President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-ap-top-news-legislation-coronavirus-pandemic-bills-2ffd868f5d3abed426e34e9427174813">COVID-19 relief package</a>: erode public support for the rescue plan by portraying it as too big, too bloated and too much wasteful public spending for a pandemic that’s almost over.</p>
<p>Senate Republicans prepared Saturday to vote lockstep against the relief bill, taking the calculated political risk that Americans will sour on the big-dollar spending for vaccination distribution, unemployment benefits, money for the states and other outlays as unnecessary, once they learn all the details.</p>
<p>Reviving a page from their 2009 takedown of President Barack Obama’s costly recovery from the financial crisis, they expect their opposition will pay political rewards, much like the earlier effort contributed to the House Republicans&#8217; rise to power.</p>
<p>It’s a tested strategy but comes at an uncertain, volatile time for the nation. Americans are experiencing flickers of optimism at the one-year anniversary of the deadly outbreak as more people are vaccinated. But new strains of the virus and a still shaky economy could unleash another devastating cycle of infections, lockdowns and deaths. More than 500,000 Americans have died.</p>
<p>So far, public support for Biden’s approach to the pandemic is high. Overall, 70% of Americans back the Democratic president’s handling of the virus response, including 44% of Republicans, according to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-norc-poll-americans-largely-back-biden-virus-response-d365bff571c24f9d3575bcbd051780aa">a new poll </a>from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.</p>
<p>Biden and Democrats warn that now is not the time to let up on aid, and that it&#8217;s better to risk doing too much than too little. They say the costs of paring back the rescue risk stalling out the economic recovery, as many believe happened in 2009.</p>
<p>“When the house is in flames, you don’t argue about how much of the fire to put out,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., during Friday’s session.</p>
<p>“You do whatever it takes until the crisis is over,” she said. “And you do it as fast as you can.”</p>
<p>The debate in Congress reflects a fundamental divide in the country over how to contain and crush the pandemic and get the nation back to normal.</p>
<p>Nearly 10 million <a href="https://apnews.com/article/unemployment-united-states-coronavirus-pandemic-economy-27d58c2e9e2931985e537a08c761507d">jobs </a>have been lost and some 11 million households face evictions. While Democratic leaders generally side with health professionals supporting social distancing restrictions and easing into school and workplace reopenings, congressional Republicans have been more eager to conduct business as close to usual as possible.</p>
<p>The U.S. is not alone in confronting the daunting dilemma that holds serious ramifications about the size and scope of aid that&#8217;s needed to prevent further economic catastrophe.</p>
<p>Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who is leading his minority party toward the &#8220;no&#8221; vote, said <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-bills-coronavirus-pandemic-ca3816a34f2405c3576251fda95ddbe3">Biden’s 628-page bill</a> is a Democratic “wish list” doesn’t meet the moment because the pandemic is lifting and the economy is ready for a “roaring recovery.&#8221;</p>
<p>“We are already on track to bounce back from the crisis,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Republicans argue Congress has already approved historic sums to counter the pandemic and worry the big spending will overheat the economy, spiking inflationary fears, though economists are mixed on those concerns. They have an opening with voters who the polling shows are skeptical of Biden&#8217;s handling of the economy.</p>
<p>McConnell expressed similar optimism last spring when he hit “pause” on new spending after approval of the initial round of aid. Around that time, then-President Donald Trump pledged that Americans would be all but back to normal by Easter Sunday.</p>
<p>But as Texas announced this past week it would seek to end face-mask wearing requirements, one of the key strategies public health officials say helps stop the spread of the virus, familiar political fault-lines and anxieties are resurfacing. Texas was among the first states to reopen in May, loosening restrictions at the start of the pandemic’s second wave that coursed through summer.</p>
<p>Jason Furman, the former chairman of Obama&#8217;s Council of Economic Advisers who now teaches at Harvard, agrees that parts of Biden’s package are too big, suggesting the $350 billion to states and cities could be reduced or have stricter guardrails against waste. But he said the bigger economic danger is in not doing enough.</p>
<p>Vaccines alone are not enough to ensure a healthy economy, he said. Households are struggling and businesses are confronting changing consumer habits and spending. The Biden package offers $1,400 direct payments to individuals, phased out for those earning $80,000 a year.</p>
<p>“If you add up the financial needs of households and the shortfalls facing states the American Rescue Plan overfills these,” he said by email. “But no legislation is perfect and, as I said, if the downside is families get a little more money in one particular year that is much less bad than if Congress fails to act.”</p>
<p>As Biden embarked on a go-it-alone partisan strategy, relying on Democratic votes for passage, Republicans are in fighting mode.</p>
<p>Senate Republicans forced an all-night reading of the bill Thursday, delaying the start of debate.</p>
<p>On Friday, senators launched an overnight session on amendments, most from Republicans, designed in part to change the bill, but also to highlight costly expenditures and less popular provisions. By early Saturday, most were failing.</p>
<p>Democrats&#8217; own amendment, to reduce extra <a href="https://apnews.com/article/senate-nears-virus-relief-bill-vote-fa965b1b413d811ad10549b3460c6643">jobless benefits from $400 a week to $300</a>, was splitting their ranks and causing further delays, before it eventually was accepted.</p>
<p>Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who forced the bill reading, used charts and props to help Americans understand the size of the $1.9 trillion package.</p>
<p>“The human mind can&#8217;t really contemplate what a trillion is,” he said, before launching into examples. He suggested a stack of $1 bills would extend the distance halfway to the moon.</p>
<p>GOP Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana said by the time they&#8217;re done they hope to turn public opinion around.</p>
<p>“We’re going to expose every ugly detail of it,” he said.</p>
<p>The White House is well aware of the challenges ahead. Many of Biden&#8217;s staff members are veterans of the 2009 battles.</p>
<p>Press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday that at the time they didn&#8217;t do enough to explain to the American people the benefits in ways &#8220;that people would be talking about at their dinner tables.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate leaders and moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin struck a deal over emergency jobless benefits, breaking a logjam that had stalled the party&#8217;s showpiece $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill.</p>
<p>The compromise, announced by the West Virginia lawmaker and a Democratic aide late Friday, seemed to clear the way for the Senate to begin a climactic, marathon series of votes and, eventually, approval of the sweeping legislation.</p>
<p>The overall bill, President Joe Biden’s foremost legislative priority, is aimed at battling the killer pandemic and nursing the staggered economy back to health. It would provide direct payments of up to $1,400 to most Americans and money for COVID-19 vaccines and testing, aid to state and local governments, help for schools and the airline industry and subsidies for health insurance.</p>
<p>The Senate next faced votes on a pile of amendments that were likely to last overnight, mostly on Republican proposals virtually certain to fail but designed to force Democrats to cast politically awkward votes.</p>
<p>More significantly, the jobless benefits agreement suggested it was just a matter of time until the Senate passes the bill. That would ship it back to the House, which was expected to give it final congressional approval and whisk it to Biden for his signature.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden supports the compromise on jobless payments.</p>
<p>The day&#8217;s lengthy standoff underscored the headaches confronting party leaders over the next two years — and the tensions between progressives and centrists — as they try moving their agenda through the Congress with their slender majorities.</p>
<p>Manchin is probably the chamber’s most conservative Democrat, and a kingmaker in the 50-50 Senate. But the party can’t tilt too far center to win Manchin’s vote without endangering progressive support in the House, where they have a mere 10-vote edge.</p>
<p>Aiding unemployed Americans is a top Democratic priority. But it’s also an issue that drives a wedge between progressives seeking to help jobless constituents cope with the bleak economy and Manchin and other moderates who have wanted to trim some of the bill’s costs.</p>
<p>Biden noted Friday&#8217;s jobs report showing that employers added 379,000 workers — an unexpectedly strong showing. That&#8217;s still small compared to the 10 million fewer jobs since the pandemic struck a year ago.</p>
<p>“Without a rescue plan, these gains are going to slow,&#8221; Biden said. “We can’t afford one step forward and two steps backwards. We need to beat the virus, provide essential relief, and build an inclusive recovery.&#8221;</p>
<p>The overall bill faces a solid wall of GOP opposition, and Republicans used the unemployment impasse to accuse Biden of refusing to seek compromise with them.</p>
<p>“You could pick up the phone and end this right now,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said of Biden.</p>
<p>But in an encouraging sign for Biden, a poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 70% of Americans support his handling of the pandemic, including a noteworthy 44% of Republicans.</p>
<p>The House approved a relief bill last weekend that included $400 weekly jobless benefits — on top of regular state payments — through August. Manchin was hoping to reduce those costs, asserting that level of payment would discourage people from returning to work, a rationale most Democrats and many economists reject.</p>
<p>As the day began, Democrats asserted they&#8217;d reached a compromise between party moderates and progressives extending emergency jobless benefits at $300 weekly into early October.</p>
<p>That plan, sponsored by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., also included tax reductions on some unemployment benefits. Without that, many Americans abruptly tossed out of jobs would face unexpected tax bills.</p>
<p>But by midday, lawmakers said Manchin was ready to support a less generous Republican version. That led to hours of talks involving White House aides, top Senate Democrats and Manchin as the party tried finding a way to salvage its unemployment aid package.</p>
<p>The compromise announced Friday night would provide $300 weekly, with the final check paid on Sept. 6, and includes the tax break on benefits.</p>
<p>Before the unemployment benefits drama began, senators voted 58-42 to kill a top progressive priority, a gradual increase in the current $7.25 hourly minimum wage to $15 over five years.</p>
<p>Eight Democrats voted against that proposal, suggesting that Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and other progressives vowing to continue the effort in coming months will face a difficult fight.</p>
<p>That vote began shortly after 11 a.m. EST and was not formally gaveled to a close until nearly 12 hours later as Senate work ground to a halt amid the unemployment benefit negotiations.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell chided Democrats, calling their daylong effort to work out the unemployment amendment a “spectacle.&#8221;</p>
<p>“What this proves is there are benefits to bipartisanship when you&#8217;re dealing with an issue of this magnitude,&#8221; McConnell said.</p>
<p>Republicans criticized the overall relief bill as a liberal spend-fest that ignores that growing numbers of vaccinations and signs of a stirring economy suggest that the twin crises are easing.</p>
<p>“Democrats inherited a tide that was already turning.” McConnell said.</p>
<p>Democrats reject that, citing the job losses and numerous people still struggling to buy food and pay rent.</p>
<p>“If you just look at a big number you say, ‘Oh, everything&#8217;s getting a little better,'&#8221; said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “It&#8217;s not for the lower half of America. It&#8217;s not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s gridlock over unemployment benefits gridlock wasn&#8217;t the first delay on the relief package. On Thursday Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., forced the chamber&#8217;s clerks to read aloud the entire 628-page relief bill, an exhausting task that took staffers 10 hours and 44 minutes and ended shortly after 2 a.m. EST.</p>
<p>Democrats made a host of other late changes to the bill, designed to nail down support. They ranged from extra money for food programs and federal subsidies for health care for workers who lose jobs to funds for rural health care and language assuring minimum amounts of money for smaller states.</p>
<p>In another late bargain that satisfied moderates, Biden and Senate Democrats agreed Wednesday to make some higher earners ineligible for the direct checks to individuals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK (AP) — One of the women who accused New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo of sexually harassing her at the workplace said she was motivated to come forward after another woman contacted her sharing similar allegations and following the Democratic governor’s name being mentioned as a potential cabinet position nominee for President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Another accuser told a television interviewer Thursday that she felt she had no choice but to answer Cuomo’s questions about her sex life, feeling pressured because “my boss was asking these questions, so I was trying to answer them.”</p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/andrew-cuomo-accused-sexual-harassment-daf35ae2ab9d3b0739c5fd4b802b9e44">Former Cuomo adviser Lindsey Boylan</a> told Harper’s Bazaar in an article published Thursday that she woke up one day in December, and saw Cuomo “being floated for attorney general, the highest law enforcement position in the U.S.”</p>
<p>She had tweeted earlier about an abusive workplace environment in the administration, but after an unnamed woman reached out to her with a story of being harassed by Cuomo and seeing the possibility of him in the Biden administration being raised, she said, “I didn’t think about it at all. … I began tweeting about my experience.”</p>
<p>The 36-year-old Boylan worked for Cuomo’s team from March 2015 to October 2018 and recounted her story of sexual harassment in the series of Twitter posts.</p>
<p>Boylan elaborated on her accusations in a Feb. 24 Medium post in which she said Cuomo once suggested a game of strip poker and on another occasion kissed her without her consent.</p>
<p>Two additional women have made accusations against the 63-year-old Cuomo since then. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-york-andrew-cuomo-7fda294d42e92a2762fc7e7b9ee0cd57">Charlotte Bennett, 25, </a>a former low-level aide, said Cuomo quizzed her about her sex life and told her he would consider dating “anyone above the age of 22.”</p>
<p>On Thursday’s edition of CBS Evening News with Norah O’Donnell, Bennett reiterated her account that she first told The New York Times.</p>
<p>“It didn’t feel like I had a choice&#8221; when it came to answering his questions, she said.</p>
<p>“I feel like people put the onus on the woman to shut that conversation down. And by answering, I was somehow engaging in that or enabling it, when in fact, I was just terrified,” Bennett said in her interview.</p>
<p>Anna Ruch, 33, told The New York Times <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cuomo-apology-blasted-charlotte-bennett-468ae8e2854ebb28f286355ba2f496ac">that Cuomo put his hands </a>on her face and asked if he could kiss her after meeting her at a September 2019 wedding.</p>
<p>Facing calls for his resignation, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/andrew-cuomo-addresses-harassment-claims-afb852a66803416add42de87a2e58fe3">Cuomo said Wednesday he would remain in office but apologized</a> for acting “in a way that made people feel uncomfortable.” He said he would cooperate with an investigation headed by state Attorney General Letitia James, a fellow Democrat.</p>
<p>Boylan told the magazine that she has been in touch with Bennett but not Ruch, adding that Ruch’s story made her feel “nauseous.”</p>
<p>She said another factor in her own decision to name Cuomo as a sexual harasser was a Cicely Tyson interview she watched <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cicely-tyson-9a513c3b75e9cb3e6fc1327088cfd06b">after Tyson’s death.</a></p>
<p>The pioneering actor cried telling the interviewer about an experience of sexual harassment 50 years earlier, Boylan recalled.</p>
<p>“I always thought that if I was ever going to tell my story, it was going to be many, many years from now,” Boylan said. “But the Tyson interview really resonated with me. It shows you how much abuse affects people.”</p>
<p>Cuomo, who is in his third term as governor, was believed to be a contender for attorney general before Biden selected federal appeals court judge Merrick Garland, who has not yet been confirmed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats agreed Friday to pare back emergency jobless benefits but extend them for an extra month, bidding to solidify support as the Senate approached a voting marathon on a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill.</p>
<p>The deal came as the chamber worked toward approving a final version of the massive package, probably over the weekend, of President Joe Biden&#8217;s top legislative priority. That would give the House time to approve the legislation and whisk it to Biden for his signature.</p>
<p>First, the Senate was preparing to vote on a mountain of amendments, mostly by GOP opponents. Virtually all are destined to fail but are designed to force Democrats to take politically awkward votes.</p>
<p>Among them, though, was a Democratic plan that was expected to pass that would trim the House bill&#8217;s $400 weekly emergency unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>Under the compromise, those payments — payable on top of regular state benefits — would be reduced to $300, but run an extra month through September. Taxes also would be reduced on unemployment benefits. A Senate Democratic aide provided details of the deal on condition of anonymity to describe private talks.</p>
<p>Biden and Senate leaders had agreed Wednesday to retain the House bill&#8217;s higher $400 version. The reduction to $300 seemed to reflect a need to secure support for the overall bill, particularly from moderate Democrats.</p>
<p>Republicans are attacking the bill as a liberal spend-fest that ignores that growing numbers of vaccinations and signs of a stirring economy suggest that the twin crises are easing.</p>
<p>“Our country is already set for a roaring recovery,&#8221; said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., in part citing an unexpectedly strong report on job creation. “Democrats inherited a tide that was already turning.”</p>
<p>Democrats reject that, citing the 10 million jobs the economy has lost during the pandemic and numerous people still struggling to buy food and pay rent.</p>
<p>“If you just look at a big number you say, ‘Oh, everything&#8217;s getting a little better,'&#8221; said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “It&#8217;s not for the lower half of America. It&#8217;s not.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an encouraging sign for Biden, a poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 70% of Americans support his handling of the pandemic, including a noteworthy 44% of Republicans.</p>
<p>Moments after the Senate took up the legislation Thursday, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., forced the chamber&#8217;s clerks to read aloud the entire 628-page measure. The exhausting task took the staffers 10 hours and 44 minutes and ended shortly after 2 a.m. EST, with Johnson alternately sitting at his desk and pacing around the mostly empty chamber.</p>
<p>Democratic leaders made more than a dozen late additions to their package on Thursday. That reflected their need to cement unanimous support from all their senators — plus Vice President Kamala Harris’ tie-breaking vote — to succeed in the precariously divided 50-50 chamber.</p>
<p>The Senate’s 51-50 vote to start debating the package, with Harris pushing Democrats over the top, underscored how they were navigating the package through Congress with virtually no margin for error. In the House their majority is a scrawny 10 votes.</p>
<p>The bill, aimed at battling the killer virus and nursing the staggered economy back to health, will provide direct payments of up to $1,400 to most Americans. There’s also money for COVID-19 vaccines and testing, aid to state and local governments, help for schools and the airline industry, tax breaks for lower-earners and families with children, and subsidies for health insurance.</p>
<p>The new provisions offered items appealing to all manner of Democrats. Progressives got money boosting feeding programs, federal subsidies for health care for workers who lose jobs, tax-free student loans, and money for public broadcasting and consumer protection investigations.</p>
<p>Moderates won funds for rural health care, language assuring minimum amounts of money for smaller states and a prohibition on states receiving aid using the windfalls to cut taxes. And for everyone, there was money for infrastructure, cultural venues, start-up companies and afterschool programs.</p>
<p>The late changes left House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the task of keeping her chamber’s numerous progressives on board. Liberals already suffered a blow when their No. 1 priority — a federal minimum wage increase to $15 hourly that was included in the House package — was booted from the bill in the Senate for violating the chamber&#8217;s rules and for lack of moderates&#8217; support.</p>
<p>In another bargain that satisfied moderates, Biden and Senate Democrats agreed Wednesday to tighten eligibility for the direct checks to individuals. The new provision completely phases out the $1,400 payments for individuals earning at least $80,000 and couples making $160,000, well lower than the original ceilings.</p>
<p>Congress wants to send the bill to Biden before March 14, when a previous round of emergency benefits for people tossed out of work by the pandemic expires.</p>
<p>Johnson told reporters he was forcing the bill&#8217;s reading to “shine the light on this abusive and obscene amount of money. ” Schumer Friday morning praised the staffers who worked late as “the unsung heroes of this place” and said of Johnson, “I hope he enjoyed his Thursday evening.”</p>
<p>The economic recovery began to stall late last year as the virus surged, causing a shortfall in hiring in recent months. The Labor Department said Friday that the economy added 379,000 jobs last month, indicating unexpected strength as virus cases fall and consumers boost spending but still leaving a long way for the country&#8217;s job market fully recovers.</p>
<p>The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates economic growth will exceed 4% this year without Biden’s rescue package. Republicans cite that as evidence the economy is pointed upward, but Democrats say a strong economic stimulus is still needed to prevent a relapse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MIAMI (AP) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and state health officials came under deeper scrutiny amid revelations that seniors in a wealthy enclave in Key Largo received hundreds of life-saving vaccinations as early as mid -January, giving ammunition to critics who say the Republican governor is favoring wealthy constituents over ordinary Floridians.</p>
<p>The revelations were the latest example of wealthy Floridians getting earlier access to coronavirus vaccines, even as the state has lagged in efforts to get poorer residents vaccinated.</p>
<p>DeSantis pushed back Thursday, saying a local hospital — not the state — was behind the vaccinations of more than 1,200 residents of the exclusive Ocean Reef Club in Key Largo, Florida, and that the state “wasn&#8217;t involved in it in any shape or form.”</p>
<p>Despite the governor&#8217;s denials of quid pro quos, the charges of favoritism were amplified by money pouring into the governor&#8217;s campaign coffers from wealthy benefactors with ties to communities awarded vaccination sites — like the one in Key Largo. One resident of Ocean Reef, Republican former Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner, last week gave the Florida governor&#8217;s campaign committee $250,000.</p>
<p>Revelations about Ocean Reef residents getting vaccinated were <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/florida-keys/article249666463.html">first reported by the Miami Herald</a>.</p>
<p>The inequitable distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines is becoming a public relations challenge for the governor. As of Wednesday, nearly 3.3 million Floridians had received at least one shot of the two-step vaccination process, about three-quarters of them 65 or older. But less than 6% have been Black — about a third of their share of the state&#8217;s population.</p>
<p>Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried joined Democratic U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist in calling for federal officials to probe the DeSantis administration’s vaccine distribution programs.</p>
<p>“If this isn’t public corruption, I don’t know what is,” Fried said Thursday at a press conference in the Florida Capitol, calling on the FBI&#8217;s public corruption to launch an investigation.</p>
<p>“Give campaign contributions big dollars, get special access to vaccines &#8212; ahead of seniors, ahead of our teachers, ahead of our farmworkers and so many of our residents here in our state of Florida who are scared and who are wanting these vaccines.”</p>
<p>Citing reporting from the Herald, Fried noted that DeSantis in February had his biggest fundraising haul since 2018, when he was running for governor.</p>
<p>In asking the U.S. Department of Justice to look into matter, Crist, a former Florida governor, asserted last week that DeSantis were benefiting &#8220;political allies and donors, over the needs of higher-risk communities and existing county waitlists.”</p>
<p>Both Crist and Fried are considering campaigns to oppose DeSantis in next year&#8217;s gubernatorial election.</p>
<p>Other Florida Democrats, including the top Democrat in the state Senate, Gary Farmer, joined in the call for a federal investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The exchange of hard-to-get vaccines for political contributions is nothing short of criminal,&#8221; Farmer said in a letter dashed off to acting U.S. Attorney General Monty Wilkinson.</p>
<p>During a Thursday news conference, DeSantis expressed no misgivings about the early vaccinations at the exclusive Key Largo community.</p>
<p>“If you are 65 and up, I am not worried about your income bracket,&#8221; he said. “I am worried about your age bracket because it’s the age, not the income, that shows the risk.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the governor called the controversy “a manufactured narrative with political motivations.”</p>
<p>“Leadership matters and because of Governor Ron DeSantis’ commitment to ensuring vaccine access to all seniors – regardless of background, income or zip code – millions of seniors have received the vaccine, resulting in over 50 percent of our state’s senior population being vaccinated, the highest in the nation,” said the spokesperson, Meredith Beatrice.</p>
<p>The Republican Party of Florida came to the governor’s defense, calling the controversy “another bogus conspiracy theory.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter what party you belong to, whether you are rich or poor, if you qualify for the vaccine, you can get a vaccine,” said Helen Aguirre Ferre, the state party’s executive director.</p>
<p>The Ocean Reef Club, a senior community in Key Largo, had more than 1,200 homeowners vaccinated through their second dose by late January, according to a message to community members by the management obtained by the Miami Herald.</p>
<p>Those vaccinations came at a time when “the majority of the state has not received an allocation of first doses,” the management noted.</p>
<p>Officials from Monroe County, home to Key Largo, said the affluent club’s medical center received the vaccines through the Baptist Health hospital as part of the governor’s program to vaccinate communities with a populations of people 65 and older. County spokeswoman Kristen Livengood said the allocations were coordinated through Baptist and the state of Florida.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, other reports have surfaced of wealthy retirement communities getting exclusive access to vaccine doses through pop-up vaccine sites. Democrats have criticized him for choosing those places, but the governor’s office has noted that more than half of them have been in Democratic stronghold counties of Broward and Palm Beach. Supporters of DeSantis say he has also coordinated clinics with faith-based groups in underserved areas.</p>
<p>Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat and the state&#8217;s director of the Division of Emergency Management, said the administration is working “diligently” to increase vaccine access in underserved communities.</p>
<p>After Publix was made the sole distributor of vaccines in Palm Beach County in late January, the mayors of predominately Black farming communities in the area urged the governor to reconsider, and the state set up a vaccine station shortly after.</p>
<p>While critics point to disparities in vaccine distributions as a call for more outreach into underserved areas of the state, including in communities of color and impoverished neighborhoods, DeSantis noted that &#8220;demand was relatively tepid in FEMA sites in Miami, Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville. The governor said the four sites had the capacity to administer 12,000 doses but only vaccinated 6,500 people.</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>A previous version of the story erroneously reported the donation amount given by former Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner to the Florida governor&#8217;s campaign committee.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (AP) — House Democrats passed sweeping voting and ethics legislation over unanimous Republican opposition, advancing to the Senate what would be the largest overhaul...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — House Democrats passed sweeping voting and ethics legislation over unanimous Republican opposition, advancing to the Senate what would be the largest overhaul of the U.S. election law in at least a generation.</p>
<p>House Resolution 1, which touches on virtually every aspect of the electoral process, was approved Wednesday night on a near party-line 220-210 vote. It would restrict partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts, strike down hurdles to voting and bring transparency to a murky campaign finance system that allows wealthy donors to anonymously bankroll political causes.</p>
<p>The bill is a powerful counterweight to voting rights restrictions advancing in Republican-controlled statehouses across the country in the wake of Donald Trump’s repeated false claims of a stolen 2020 election. Yet it faces an uncertain fate in the Democratic-controlled Senate, where it has little chance of passing without changes to procedural rules that currently allow Republicans to block it.</p>
<p>The stakes in the outcome are monumental, cutting to the foundational idea that one person equals one vote, and carrying with it the potential to shape election outcomes for years to come. It also offers a test of how hard President Joe Biden and his party are willing to fight for their priorities, as well as those of their voters.</p>
<p>This bill “will put a stop at the voter suppression that we’re seeing debated right now,” said Rep. Nikema Williams, a new congresswoman who represents the Georgia district that deceased voting rights champion John Lewis held for years. “This bill is the ‘Good Trouble’ he fought for his entire life.”</p>
<p>To Republicans, however, it would give license to unwanted federal interference in states&#8217; authority to conduct their own elections — ultimately benefiting Democrats through higher turnout, most notably among minorities.</p>
<p>“Democrats want to use their razor-thin majority not to pass bills to earn voters’ trust, but to ensure they don’t lose more seats in the next election,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said from the House floor Tuesday.</p>
<p>The measure has been a priority for Democrats since they won their House majority in 2018. But it has taken on added urgency in the wake of Trump’s false claims, which incited the deadly storming of the U.S. Capitol in January.</p>
<p>Courts and even Trump&#8217;s last attorney general, William Barr, found his claims about the election to be without merit. But, spurred on by those lies, state lawmakers across the U.S. have filed more than 200 bills in 43 states that would limit ballot access, according to a tally kept by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.</p>
<p>In Iowa, the legislature voted to cut absentee and in-person early voting, while preventing local elections officials from setting up additional locations to make early voting easier. In Georgia, the House on Monday voted for legislation requiring identification to vote by mail that would also allow counties to cancel early in-person voting on Sundays, when many Black voters cast ballots after church.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Supreme Court appeared ready to uphold voting restrictions in Arizona, which could make it harder to challenge state election laws in the future.</p>
<p>When asked why proponents sought to uphold the Arizona laws, which limit who can turn in absentee ballots and enable ballots to be thrown out if they are cast in the wrong precinct, a lawyer for the state&#8217;s Republican Party was stunningly clear.</p>
<p>“Because it puts us at a competitive disadvantage relative to Democrats,” said attorney Michael Carvin. “Politics is a zero-sum game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Battle lines are quickly being drawn by outside groups who plan to spend millions of dollars on advertising and outreach campaigns.</p>
<p>Republicans “are not even being coy about it. They are saying the ‘quiet parts’ out loud,” said Tiffany Muller, the president of End Citizens United, a left-leaning group that aims to curtail the influence of corporate money in politics. Her organization has launched a $10 million effort supporting the bill. “For them, this isn’t about protecting our democracy or protecting our elections. This is about pure partisan political gain.”</p>
<p>Conservatives, meanwhile, are mobilizing a $5 million pressure campaign, urging moderate Senate Democrats to oppose rule changes needed to pass the measure.</p>
<p>“H.R. 1 is not about making elections better,” said Ken Cuccinelli, a former Trump administration Homeland Security official who is leading the effort. &#8220;It’s about the opposite. It’s intended to dirty up elections.”</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s actually in the bill?</p>
<p>H.R. 1 would require states to automatically register eligible voters, as well as offer same-day registration. It would limit states&#8217; ability to purge registered voters from their rolls and restore former felons&#8217; voting rights. Among dozens of other provisions, it would also require states to offer 15 days of early voting and allow no-excuse absentee balloting.</p>
<p>On the cusp of a once-in-a-decade redrawing of congressional district boundaries, typically a fiercely partisan affair, the bill would mandate that nonpartisan commissions handle the process instead of state legislatures.</p>
<p>Many Republican opponents in Congress have focused on narrower aspects, like the creation of a public financing system for congressional campaigns that would be funded through fines and settlement proceeds raised from corporate bad actors.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve also attacked an effort to revamp the federal government&#8217;s toothless elections cop. That agency, the Federal Election Commission, has been gripped by partisan deadlock for years, allowing campaign finance law violators to go mostly unchecked.</p>
<p>Another section that&#8217;s been a focus of Republican ire would force the disclosure of donors to “dark money” political groups, which are a magnet for wealthy interests looking to influence the political process while remaining anonymous.</p>
<p>Still, the biggest obstacles lie ahead in the Senate, which is split 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats.</p>
<p>On some legislation, it takes only 51 votes to pass, with Vice President Kamala Harris as the tiebreaker. On a deeply divisive bill like this one, they would need 60 votes under the Senate’s rules to overcome a Republican filibuster — a tally they are unlikely to reach.</p>
<p>Some Democrats have discussed options like lowering the threshold to break a filibuster, or creating a workaround that would allow priority legislation, including a separate John Lewis Voting Rights bill, to be exempt. Biden has been cool to filibuster reforms and Democratic congressional aides say the conversations are fluid but underway.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has not committed to a time frame but vowed “to figure out the best way to get big, bold action on a whole lot of fronts.”</p>
<p>He said: “We’re not going to be the legislative graveyard. &#8230; People are going to be forced to vote on them, yes or no, on a whole lot of very important and serious issues.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden and Democrats agreed to tighten eligibility limits for stimulus checks, bowing to party moderates as leaders prepared to move their $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill through the Senate.</p>
<p>At the same time, the White House and top Democrats stood by progressives and agreed that the Senate package would retain the $400 weekly emergency unemployment benefits included in the House-passed pandemic legislation. Moderates have wanted to trim those payments to $300 after Republicans have called the bill so heedlessly generous that it would prompt some people to not return to work.</p>
<p>The dealmaking Wednesday underscored the balancing act Democrats face as they try squeezing the massive relief measure through the evenly divided, 50-50 Senate. The package, Biden’s signature legislative priority, is his attempt to stomp out <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-manage-pandemic-expectations-35a1e534f83860a074f09b85eadbaa71">the year-old pandemic</a>, revive <a href="https://apnews.com/article/united-states-coronavirus-pandemic-monetary-policy-economy-0de5d17dd0007d3cf208c32578d3f7a2">an economy that’s shed 10 million jobs</a> and bring some semblance of normality to countless upended lives.</p>
<p>Democrats have no choice but to broker compromises among themselves, thanks to their mere 10-vote House margin and a Senate they control only with Vice President Kamala Harris’ tie-breaking vote. The party’s moderate and progressive factions are competing to use their leverage, but without going so far as to scuttle an effort they all support.</p>
<p>“He’s pleased with the progress that is being made with the rescue plan,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said of Biden, reflecting the flexibility he and all Democrats will need to prevail. “He’s always said he’s open to good ideas.”</p>
<p>So far, Republicans have presented a unified front against the bill. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he wants unanimous GOP opposition.</p>
<p>But Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, didn&#8217;t rule out breaking ranks and supporting the measure. She told reporters her state&#8217;s tourism industry has been walloped by the pandemic and said she&#8217;s talked to administration officials about “how this helps a state like Alaska.”</p>
<p>The Senate could begin debating the bill Thursday, but Democrats faced mountains of GOP amendments and other delays that could take days to plow through. The House will have to approve the Senate’s version before shipping it to Biden, which Democrats want to do before the last round of emergency jobless benefits run dry March 14.</p>
<p>“I would expect a very long night into the next day and keep going on,” said Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., describing GOP plans to force votes.</p>
<p>Under the legislation, individuals earning up to $75,000, and couples up to $150,000, would get $1,400 checks per person. The House-approved version would gradually phase down that amount, with individuals making $100,000 and couples earning $200,000 receiving nothing.</p>
<p>Under Wednesday’s agreement, the Senate bill would instead halt the payments completely for individuals making $80,000 and couples earning $160,000, said a Democratic official, who described the agreement only on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>That means some people who received the last round of $600 relief checks approved in December wouldn&#8217;t get anything this time. The liberal Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimated that the pared-down Senate eligibility levels means 280 million adults and children would receive stimulus checks, compared to 297 million people under the House plan.</p>
<p>West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, perhaps the chamber&#8217;s most conservative Democrat, has favored lowering the relief check eligibility limits and opposed the House bill&#8217;s minimum wage increase. He suggested Wednesday he&#8217;d back the emerging Senate legislation, saying it “really does have enough good stuff that we should be able to make this work.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a swipe at moderates, Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., a leader of his chamber’s progressives, called the new phase-out of relief checks a “silly and stupid” effort to appease “the one or two people who can hold things up.”</p>
<p>Yet asked if the change could threaten the overall bill, Pocan said, “Let’s hope they don’t screw too many things up. We need to get this done.”</p>
<p>Liberals were already angry after Senate Democrats jettisoned the House bill’s minimum wage increase to $15 by 2025. They did so after the Senate parliamentarian said the chamber’s rules wouldn’t allow the boost in the bill and as Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., said they’d oppose its inclusion, sealing its fate.</p>
<p>The House version of the relief checks would cost $422 billion, making them the package’s single most expensive item.</p>
<p>The two chambers&#8217; bills are largely similar, with both bearing money for state and municipal governments, COVID-19 vaccines and testing, schools, health care subsidies and tax breaks for children and lower-earning people.</p>
<p>Republicans continued lashing the measure as an overpriced Democratic wish list of liberal causes that lavishes help on many who don’t really need it.</p>
<p>“Democrats had a choice,” McConnell said. “They chose to go it alone, tack to the left, leave families&#8217; top priorities on the cutting room floor.”</p>
<p>“This is not a liberal wish list,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “This is an American wish list. When people want checks to help them get out of the morass, that&#8217;s not a liberal wish list. That&#8217;s what the American people want.”</p>
<p>Slowly, the Senate bill&#8217;s contours were taking shape.</p>
<p>Senate Democrats were removing $1.5 million for a bridge between New York state and Canada and around $140 million for a rapid transit project south of San Francisco after Republicans cast both as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-news-transportation-coronavirus-pandemic-san-jose-bills-7805439089c9ac01b4c1a1316d21109c">pet projects f</a> or Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D—Calif.</p>
<p>Aides to both Democratic leaders said the projects weren’t new and had been supported by the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Democrats are using special rules that will let them avoid GOP filibusters that would require them to garner an impossible 60 votes to approve the legislation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — House Democrats passed the most ambitious effort in decades to overhaul policing nationwide, avoiding a potential clash with moderates in their own party who were wary of reigniting the “defund the police” debate they say hurt them during last fall&#8217;s election.</p>
<p>Approved 220-212 late Wednesday, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is named for the man whose killing by police in Minnesota last Memorial Day sparked demonstrations nationwide. It would ban chokeholds and “qualified immunity” for law enforcement while creating national standards for policing in a bid to bolster accountability, and was first approved last summer only to stall in the then-Republican controlled Senate. The bill is supported by President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>“My city is not an outlier, but rather an example of the inequalities our country has struggled with for centuries,” said Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who represents the Minneapolis area near where Floyd died.</p>
<p>Floyd’s family watched the emotional debate from a nearby House office building and said “defunding the police” is not what the legislation is about.</p>
<p>“We just want to be treated equal. We just want to deescalate situations,” said Brandon Williams, Floyd’s nephew. “We want to feel safe when we encounter law enforcement. We’re not asking for anything extra. We’re not asking for anything that we don’t feel is right.”</p>
<p>Democrats hustled to pass the bill a second time, hoping to combat police brutality and institutional racism after the deaths of Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other Black Americans following interactions with law enforcement — images of which were sometimes jarringly captured on video.</p>
<p>But the debate over legislation turned into a political liability for Democrats as Republicans seized on calls by some activists and progressives to “defund the police” to argue that supporters were intent on slashing police force budgets.</p>
<p>Though this bill doesn&#8217;t do that, moderate Democrats said the charge helped drive Democratic defeats in swing districts around the country last November.</p>
<p>“No one ran on ‘defund the police,’ but all you have to do is make that a political weapon,” said Teas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar.</p>
<p>Republicans quickly revived the “defund the police” criticisms before the vote. “Our law enforcement officers need more funding not less,” Rep. Scott Fitzgerald, R-Wis.</p>
<p>Still, even the House’s more centrist lawmakers, some representing more conservative districts, ultimately backed the bill.</p>
<p>“Black Americans have endured generations of systemic racism and discrimination for too long, and this has been painfully evident in their treatment by law enforcement,” said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash, who chairs the moderate New Democrat Coalition.</p>
<p>That endorsement came despite the bill’s prohibitions on so-called qualified immunity, which shields law enforcement from certain lawsuits and is one of the main provisions that will likely need to be negotiated in any compromise with the Senate. Another possible point of contention is provisions easing standards for prosecution of law enforcement officers accused of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Police unions and other law enforcement groups have argued that, without legal protections, fear of lawsuits will stop people from becoming police officers — even though the measure permits suits only against law enforcement agencies, rather than all public employees.</p>
<p>California Rep. Karen Bass, who authored the bill, understands the challenge some House members face in supporting it.</p>
<p>“My colleagues, several of them, I do not make light of the difficulty they had getting reelected because of the lie around defunding the police,” Bass said.</p>
<p>She called provisions limiting qualified immunity as well as those changing standards for prosecution “the only measures that hold police accountable — that will actually decrease the number of times we have to see people killed on videotape.”</p>
<p>Civil rights attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci released a statement on behalf of the Floyd family saying the House was “responding to the mandate issued by thousands of Americans who took to the streets last summer to raise their voices for change.”</p>
<p>“This represents a major step forward to reform the relationship between police officers and communities of color and impose accountability on law enforcement officers whose conscious decisions preserve the life or cause the death of Americans, including so many people of color,” Crump and Romanucci said. “Now we urge the Senate to follow suit.”</p>
<p>That may be a taller order. Even though Democrats now control both chambers of Congress, it seems unlikely the bill could pass the Senate without substantial changes to win GOP support.</p>
<p>Bass acknowledged the challenges Democrats faced last November — and may likely see again — when former President Donald Trump&#8217;s reelection campaign and other leading Republicans crowded the airwaves with images of cities around the country burning. But she said those attacks, like much of the opposition to the bill, are built on racism, promoting fears about how “the scary Black people are going to attack you if you try to rein in the police.”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s as old as apple pie in our history,” she said. “So do you not act because of that?”</p>
<p>Still, Bass conceded that changes are likely to come if the measure is to win the minimum 60 votes it will need to advance in the Senate, which is now split 50-50. She said she&#8217;d been in contact with South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only Black Republican in the chamber, and was confident he would help deliver some GOP support.</p>
<p>Scott said this week that the legislation&#8217;s sticking points were qualified immunity and prosecutorial standards and that in both areas, “We have to protect individual officers.”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s a red line for me,” Scott said, adding, “Hopefully we&#8217;ll come up with something that actually works.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday said intends to remain in office in the face of sexual harassment allegations that have weakened his support and led to calls for his resignation.</p>
<p>The Democratic governor, speaking somberly in his first public appearance since three women accused him of inappropriate touching and offensive remarks, apologized and said that he “learned an important lesson” about his behavior around women.</p>
<p>“I now understand that I acted in a way that made people feel uncomfortable,” Cuomo said. “It was unintentional and I truly and deeply apologize for it.”</p>
<p>Asked about calls for him to step aside, the third-term governor said: “I wasn’t elected by politicians, I was elected by the people of the state of New York. I’m not going to resign.”</p>
<p>Cuomo acknowledged “sensitivities have changed and behavior has changed” and that what he considers his “customary greeting” — an old-world approach that often involving kisses and hugs — is no longer acceptable.</p>
<p>But the allegations against the governor go beyond aggressive greetings.</p>
<p>Former aide Lindsey Boylan accuses Cuomo of having harassed her throughout her employment and said he once suggesting a game of strip poker aboard his state-owned jet. Another former aide, Charlotte Bennett, said Cuomo once asked her if she ever had sex with older men.</p>
<p>Both women rejected Cuomo&#8217;s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-news-new-york-andrew-cuomo-state-governments-ea867148e3d5800282dd49ba28f604dc">latest apology, </a>doubling down on their disgust after he issued a statement Sunday attempting to excuse his behavior as his way of being “playful.&#8221;</p>
<p>“How can New Yorkers trust you @NYGovCuomo to lead our state if you ‘don’t know’ when you’ve been inappropriate with your own staff?” Boylan tweeted.</p>
<p>Cuomo said he will “fully cooperate” with an investigation into the allegations being overseen by the state&#8217;s independently elected attorney general. Attorney General Letitia James, also a Democrat, is in the process of selecting an outside law firm to conduct the probe and document its findings in a public report.</p>
<p>Cuomo addressed the allegations during a news conference that otherwise focused on the state’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, the kind of briefings that made him a daily fixture on TV and a national star among Democrats.</p>
<p>Before that, Cuomo last spoke to reporters during a conference call on Feb. 22. His last briefing on camera was Feb. 19.</p>
<p>Two of the women accusing Cuomo worked in his administration. The other was a guest at a wedding that he officiated.</p>
<p>Bennett, 25, said Cuomo <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-york-andrew-cuomo-7fda294d42e92a2762fc7e7b9ee0cd57">quizzed her about her sex life</a>, asked if she felt age made a difference in relationships and said that he was fine dating &#8220;anyone above the age of 22.&#8221; Bennett said she believed he was gauging her interest in an affair. Cuomo has denied making advances at Bennett.</p>
<p>Boylan, 36, said <a href="https://apnews.com/article/andrew-cuomo-accused-sexual-harassment-daf35ae2ab9d3b0739c5fd4b802b9e44">Cuomo commented on her appearance</a> inappropriately, kissed her without her consent at the end of a meeting and went out of his way to touch her on her lower back, arms and legs. Cuomo has denied Boylan’s allegations.</p>
<p>Anna Ruch told The New York Times that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cuomo-apology-blasted-charlotte-bennett-468ae8e2854ebb28f286355ba2f496ac">Cuomo put his hands on her face</a> and asked if he could kiss her just moments after they met at a September 2019 wedding in Manhattan.</p>
<p>Bennett&#8217;s lawyer, Debra Katz, said the governor&#8217;s news conference “was full of falsehoods and inaccurate information.”</p>
<p>She said Cuomo&#8217;s claim that he was unaware he had made women uncomfortable was disingenuous, considering that Bennett had reported his behavior to her boss and one of Cuomo&#8217;s lawyers.</p>
<p>“We are confident that they made him aware of her complaint and we fully expect that the Attorney General’s investigation will demonstrate that Cuomo administration officials failed to act on Ms. Bennett’s serious allegations or to ensure that corrective measures were taken, in violation of their legal requirements,” Katz said.</p>
<p>Cuomo’s support has plummeted amid a one-two punch of scandals, and even some Democrats have called on him to step aside. The harassment allegations follow accusations that Cuomo covered up the true <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-york-andrew-cuomo-us-news-coronavirus-pandemic-nursing-homes-512cae0abb55a55f375b3192f2cdd6b5">COVID-19 death toll on nursing home residents</a>.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s in his DNA to resign or back down,” said Queens Assembly member Ron Kim, a Democrat who accused Cuomo of bullying him over the nursing home issue. “I think he will do whatever it takes to fight this.”</p>
<p>Cuomo said he inherited his gregarious way of greeting people from his father, the late former Gov. Mario Cuomo, and that he intended it as a way of welcoming people and making them feel comfortable. He said he realizes now, “it doesn’t matter my intent, what it matters is if anybody was offended by it.”</p>
<p>Speaking about the allegations, Cuomo initially said he was apologizing to “people” who were uncomfortable with his conduct, but he didn’t make clear as he continued which of the women he was referring to.</p>
<p>At one point, he said he was apologizing to “the young woman who worked here who said that I made her feel uncomfortable in the workplace,” though that description could apply to both Boylan and Bennett.</p>
<p>Asked what he was saying to New Yorkers, Cuomo said: “I’m embarrassed by what happened&#8230; I’m embarrassed that someone felt that way in my administration. I’m embarrassed and hurt and I apologize that somebody who interacted with me felt that way.”</p>
<p>The governor, who has touted a law requiring all workers in New York to receive sexual harassment training, said he felt at the time that his behavior was innocuous but now acknowledges that sexual harassment centers on how the victim is impacted — not the offender’s intent.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know at the time I was making her feel uncomfortable. I never meant to, but that doesn’t matter,&#8221; Cuomo said. &#8220;If a person feels uncomfortable, if a person feels pain, if a person is offended, I feel very badly about that and I apologize for it. There&#8217;s no but — it&#8217;s, &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8217;”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Law enforcement was on high alert Thursday around the U.S. Capitol after authorities said intelligence had uncovered a “possible plot” by a militia group to storm the iconic building again. The alert came two months after Donald Trump supporters smashed through windows and doors to try to stop Congress from certifying now-President Joe Biden&#8217;s victory.</p>
<p>The threat appeared to be connected to a far-right conspiracy theory, mainly promoted by supporters of QAnon, that former President Trump would rise again to power on March 4 and that thousands would come to Washington to try to remove Democrats from office. March 4 was the original presidential inauguration day until 1933, when it was moved to Jan. 20.</p>
<p>There were no signs of disturbance Thursday at the heavily secured building, with Capitol Police and National Guardsmen on duty and a large fence around the perimeter that was put in place after the Jan. 6 riot. The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-capitol-siege-politics-riots-c1b4973dce1b48c17c3dca7f5fb6e5fb">Pentagon is reviewing a request to extend the Guard deployment 60 days</a> beyond its current expiration date of March 12.</p>
<p>Online chatter identified by authorities included discussions among members of the Three Percenters, an anti-government militia group, concerning possible plots against the Capitol on Thursday, according to two law enforcement officials who were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Members of the Three Percenters <a href="https://apnews.com/article/white-supremacy-threats-capitol-riots-2d4ba4d1a3d55197489d773b3e0b0f32">were among the extremists who stormed</a> the Capitol on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>The threat came as the Capitol police and other law enforcement agencies were taking criticism from Congress in contentious hearings this week on their <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/capitol-siege">handling of the Jan. 6 riot. </a>Police <a href="https://apnews.com/article/riots-police-michael-pence-capitol-siege-0dfa12d17208295506ca094101e1f838">were ill-prepared</a> for the mass of Trump supporters, some in tactical gear and armed, and it took hours for National Guard reinforcements to come. By then, rioters had broken into the building and they roamed the halls for hours, stalling Congress&#8217; certification effort temporarily and sending lawmakers into hiding.</p>
<p>Lawmakers, congressional staffers and law enforcement officials are still on edge after the attack on Jan. 6, even as security around the Capitol remains at an unprecedented level.</p>
<p>The U.S. House wrapped up its work for the week Wednesday night, but the U.S. Senate still had a busy day scheduled for Thursday with votes into the evening. Police beefed up their presence in and around the Capitol. About 5,200 National Guard members remain in D.C., the remainder of the roughly 26,000 who were brought in for President Biden&#8217;s inauguration in January, which went off with no problems.</p>
<p>Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, the former chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee and among those briefed about the new threat, said lawmakers were braced.</p>
<p>“I think we’ll see some violence here,” he said in an interview.</p>
<p>But unlike on Jan. 6, the Capitol is now fortified against intrusions. “We have the razor wire, we have the National Guard. We didn’t have that January 6. So I feel very confident in the security,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Initially it seemed as though the online chatter did not rise to the level of serious concern; an advisory sent earlier this week to members of Congress by Timothy Blodgett, the acting House sergeant-at-arms, said the Capitol Police had “no indication that groups will travel to Washington, D.C., to protest or commit acts of violence.”</p>
<p>But that advisory was updated in a note to lawmakers Wednesday morning. Blodgett wrote that the Capitol Police had received “new and concerning information and intelligence indicating additional interest in the Capitol for the dates of March 4th – 6th by a militia group.”</p>
<p>Acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman said during House testimony Wednesday that her investigators had collected “some concerning intelligence,” but declined to provide any details publicly, saying that it was “law enforcement sensitive” and that she would provide a private briefing for the subcommittee members.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, federal agents found no significant increases in the number of hotel rooms being rented in Washington, or in flights to the area, car rental reservations or buses being chartered, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. The person could not publicly discuss details of the security planning and spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>The FBI and Department of Homeland Security also sent a joint intelligence bulletin to local law enforcement officials Tuesday that said a group of militia extremists had discussed trying to take control of the Capitol on March 4 and encouraging thousands of people to come to D.C. to try to remove Democrats from power.</p>
<p>But there has been a noticeable decline in online activity on some social media platforms surrounding efforts on March 4, and there was already considerably less online chatter than during the lead-up to Jan. 6, a day that Trump repeatedly had promoted for a his rally and encouraged thousands to come to the nation&#8217;s capital.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/9a5539af34b15338bb5c4923907eeb67">thousands of accounts </a>that promoted the Jan. 6 event that led to a violent storming of the U.S. Capitol have since been suspended by major tech companies like Facebook and Twitter, making it far more difficult for groups to organize a repeat of the mass gathering.</p>
<p>So far, about <a href="https://apnews.com/article/capitol-riots-extremist-rhetoric-a5db204fa5b07ffca694a8d96323ae15">300 people have been charged </a>with federal crimes for their roles in the riot. Five people, including a Capitol Police officer, died.</p>
<p>Since his defeat, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/conspiracy-theories-state-elections-misinformation-elections-voting-d1a8f797a03ffcd88972b9634b56a690">Trump has been promoting lies that the election was stolen</a> from him through mass voter fraud, even though such claims have been rejected by judges, Republican state officials and Trump’s own administration. He was impeached by the House after the Jan. 6 riot on a c<a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-capitol-siege-riots-acquittals-impeachments-6fb642f97be5f2bd202e8bc002d6a167">harge of incitement of insurrection</a> but was acquitted by the Senate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK (AP) — As widely anticipated, Fox News said Tuesday that it had signed former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany as a contributor to offer commentary on various network programs.</p>
<p>McEnany, former President Donald Trump&#8217;s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-joe-biden-kayleigh-mcenany-joe-lockhart-db516ee1055da1891cc3b32b0b9d4ff8">final press secretary</a>, didn&#8217;t speak about her new role during an interview with Fox&#8217;s Harris Faulkner that aired Tuesday.</p>
<p>It was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-larry-kudlow-kayleigh-mcenany-58f61b819e20ce588dc84723dabb3306">reported in January</a> that McEnany had disclosed to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics while still in office that she would work for Fox after leaving the White House. Fox said at the time that it had been in discussions with McEnany but had paused them.</p>
<p>Before working for Trump, McEnany was a commentator at CNN.</p>
<p>While at the White House, McEnany frequently appeared on Fox News programs for interviews.</p>
<p>She said Tuesday that her biggest regret at the White House was not being able to hold a briefing outlining all the accomplishments of the Trump administration.</p>
<p>“But after Jan. 6, it just was not tenable,” she said.</p>
<p>She said that “everyone in the administration was horrified” by the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, led by a mob of Trump supporters, but she insisted that it did not represent the former president&#8217;s backers.</p>
<p>Asked if she believed Trump bore any responsibility for the riot, she said, “No, I don&#8217;t.”</p>
<p>Trump was impeached by the House on a charge of incitement of insurrection over the insurrection but acquitted by the House. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell voted to acquit Trump, citing the fact that the former president was out of office by the time the Senate trial began, but McConnell said Trump was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-donald-trump-impeachments-trump-impeachment-mitch-mcconnell-0a14d2e41e376331580b98a992f7d856">&#8220;practically and morally responsible for provoking&#8221;</a> the riot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — FBI Director Christopher Wray bluntly labeled the January riot at the U.S. Capitol as “domestic terrorism” Tuesday and warned of a rapidly growing threat of homegrown violent extremism that law enforcement is scrambling to confront through thousands of investigations.</p>
<p>Wray also defended to lawmakers his own agency&#8217;s handling of an intelligence report that warned of the prospect for violence on Jan. 6. And he firmly rejected false claims advanced by some Republicans that anti-Trump groups had organized the deadly riot that began when a violent mob stormed the building as Congress was gathering to certify results of the presidential election.</p>
<p>Wray&#8217;s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, his first before Congress since the insurrection, was one in a series of hearings centered on the law enforcement response to the Capitol insurrection. Lawmakers pressed him not only about possible intelligence and communication failures ahead of the riot but also about the threat of violence from white supremacists, militias and other extremists that the FBI says it is prioritizing with the same urgency as the menace of international terrorism organizations.</p>
<p>“Jan. 6 was not an isolated event. The problem of domestic terrorism has been metastasizing across the country for a long time now and it’s not going away anytime soon,” Wray told lawmakers. “At the FBI, we’ve been sounding the alarm on it for a number of years now.”</p>
<p>The violence at the Capitol made clear that a law enforcement agency that remade itself after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to deal with international terrorism is now laboring to address homegrown violence by white Americans. President Joe Biden’s administration has tasked his national intelligence director to work with the FBI and Department of Homeland Security to assess the threat. And in applying the domestic terrorism label to conduct inside the Capitol, Wray sought to make clear to senators that he was clear-eyed about the scope and urgency of the problem.</p>
<p>In quantifying the scale of the FBI&#8217;s work, Wray said the number of domestic terrorism investigations has increased from around 1,000 when he became director in 2017 to roughly 1,400 at the end of last year to about 2,000 now. The number of arrests of white supremacists and other racially motivated extremists has almost tripled, he said.</p>
<p>Many of the senators&#8217; questions Tuesday centered on the FBI&#8217;s handling of a Jan. 5 report from its Norfolk, Virginia, field office that warned of online posts foreshadowing a “war” in Washington the following day. Capitol Police leaders have said they were unaware of the report at the time, and the former chief of the department has said he received no intelligence from the FBI that would have led him to anticipate the sort of violence that besieged them on the 6th.</p>
<p>Five people died that day, including a Capitol Police officer and a woman who was shot as she tried to climb through a smashed window into the House chamber with lawmakers still inside.</p>
<p>Wray said the report was disseminated though the FBI’s joint terrorism task force, discussed at a command post in Washington and posted on an internet portal available to other law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>Though the information was raw, unverified and appeared aspirational in nature, Wray said, it was specific and concerning enough that “the smartest thing to do, the most prudent thing to do, was just push it to the people who needed to get it.”</p>
<p>“We did communicate that information in a timely fashion to the Capitol Police and (Metropolitan Police Department) in not one, not two, but three different ways,” Wray said, though he added that since the violence that ensued was “not an acceptable result,” the FBI was looking into what it could have done differently.</p>
<p>He said he was “reluctant to armchair quarterback anyone else in their jobs,” but the FBI was determined to prevent a repeat of Jan. 6.</p>
<p>“We find it personally infuriating any time we are not able, as I said, to bat 1,000. And we’re going to keep working to get better,” he said.</p>
<p>The sprawling Justice Department investigation into the riot has already produced hundreds of charges, including against members of militia groups and far-right organizations. The crowd in Washington that day ranged from protesters who did not break any laws to a smaller group that arrived determined to commit violence against police and disrupt Congress from its duties, Wray said.</p>
<p>“Some of those people clearly came to Washington, we now know, with the plans and intentions to engage in the worst kind of violence we would consider domestic terrorism,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Asked whether there was evidence that the attack was planned or carried out by antifa — an umbrella term for leftist militants — or by Trump opponents posing as his loyalists, Wray said that there was not. Some on the right have made such false contentions.</p>
<p>Even as the FBI prioritizes its efforts to counter domestic violent extremism, there are challenges confronting law enforcement, including in separating mere chatter from actual threats and in First Amendment protections that give ample leeway to espouse racist or otherwise abhorrent viewpoints.</p>
<p>&#8220;The amount of angry, hateful, unspeakable, combative, violent even, rhetoric on social media exceeds what anybody in their worst imagination (thinks) is out there,” Wray said.</p>
<p>Wray has kept a notably low profile since the Capitol attack. Though he has briefed lawmakers privately and shared information with local law enforcement, Tuesday&#8217;s oversight hearing marked his first public appearance before Congress since before November&#8217;s presidential election.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden said the U.S. expects to take delivery of enough coronavirus vaccine for all adults by the end of May — two months earlier than anticipated — and he pushed states to get at least one shot into the arms of teachers by the end of March to hasten school reopenings.</p>
<p>Biden also announced Tuesday that drugmaker Merck will help produce rival Johnson &amp; Johnson’s newly approved one-shot vaccine, likening the partnership between the two drug companies to the spirit of national cooperation during World War II.</p>
<p>“We’re now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Despite the stepped-up pace of vaccine production, the work of inoculating Americans could extend well into the summer, officials said, depending both on the government’s capacity to deliver doses and Americans’ willingness to roll up their sleeves.</p>
<p>Biden’s announcements quickly raised expectations for when the nation could safely emerge from the pandemic with the promise of speedier vaccinations, but even as he expressed optimism, Biden quickly tempered the outlook for a return to life as it was before the virus hit.</p>
<p>“I’ve been cautioned not to give an answer to that because we don’t know for sure,” Biden said, before saying his hope for a return to normal was sometime before “this time next year.”</p>
<p>As Biden spoke, states across the country were moving to relax virus-related restrictions. This despite the objections of the White House and the nation&#8217;s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who have warned against any relaxation of virus protocols until more Americans are vaccinated.</p>
<p>In Texas, GOP Gov. Greg Abbott moved to lift his state’s mask-wearing mandate and a host of other limitations. Michigan’s Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer eased capacity limits on restaurants and both public and residential gatherings.</p>
<p>Fauci has previously said the nation must achieve a vaccination rate of about 80% to reach “herd immunity.&#8221; Only about 8% of the population has been fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, though the pace of vaccination has been increasing. The U.S. set a new daily record for injections last Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>In hopes of increasing vaccinations even further. the Biden administration told governors to make preparations to administer even more doses in the coming weeks. More shots are also headed toward the federally backed program to administer doses in retail pharmacies, which federal officials believe can double or triple their pace of vaccination.</p>
<p>More than 800,000 doses of the J&amp;J vaccine will also be distributed this week to pharmacies, on top of the 2.4 million they are now getting from Pfizer and Moderna.</p>
<p>Those pharmacies will be key in getting the vaccines into the arms of teachers — particularly in the roughly 20 states where they have not been prioritized for shots. The aim is to help reopen schools to better educate students who have been at risk of falling behind during the pandemic and reduce the burden on parents who have had to choose between childcare and a job.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let’s treat in-person learning as the essential service that it is,&#8221; Biden said. Teachers will be able to sign up directly through participating retail pharmacies, the administration said.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki also announced Tuesday that the federal government was increasing supply of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines to states next week to 15.2 million doses per week, up from 14.5 million previously. States will also receive 2.8 million doses of the J&amp;J shot this week.</p>
<p>On a call with governors Tuesday, White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients said states should prepare to administer 16 million to 17 million total weekly doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines by the end of March, climbing to 17 million to 18 million weekly by early April. The supply of J&amp;J doses to states, expected to dip after the initial shipment this week, will climb to 4 million to 6 million weekly doses by the end of March and 5 million to 6 million doses weekly through the end of April.</p>
<p>Officials have said J&amp;J faced unexpected production issues with its vaccine and produced only 3.9 million doses before being cleared for emergency use authorization on Saturday. The company has promised to deliver 100 million doses by the end of June.</p>
<p>Before the approval of the J&amp;J shot, Biden had suggested that it would take until the end of July to have enough vaccine for every adult in the U.S.</p>
<p>Facing questions about the company&#8217;s slipping delivery schedule, J&amp;J Vice President Richard Nettles told lawmakers on Capitol Hill last week that the company had faced “significant challenges” because of its “highly complex” manufacturing process.</p>
<p>Psaki said that an &#8220;across-the-administration effort” was required to get the two historic rivals to work together on the vaccines, even though conversations between J&amp;J and Merck have been going on for months.</p>
<p>“There’s a difference between conversations and it moving forward,” she said.</p>
<p>The White House said Merck would devote two plants to the production process. One would make the vaccine and the other would handle inserting the vaccine into vials and ensuring strict quality controls. Psaki said the Biden administration was using its powers under the Defense Production Act to help Merck retool to work on the production.</p>
<p>Still it was not immediately clear when the effect of Merck’s assistance would be reflected in supply. Federal officials have cautioned that setting up the highly specialized manufacturing lines to produce vaccines would take months.</p>
<p>Compared to the two-dose versions produced by Moderna and Pfizer, the J&amp;J vaccine is less resource-intensive to distribute and administer, making it critical for U.S. plans to spread vaccinations around the world — but only once Americans are inoculated. The J&amp;J vaccine can be stored for months at refrigerated temperatures, rather than frozen, and doesn’t require patients to return for a second dose three or four weeks later.</p>
<p>J&amp;J has set up a global production network that includes brewing bulk vaccine at its Janssen facility in the Netherlands, and with a company in the U.S., Emergent BioSolutions, and another in India, Biological E. Ltd. Other contract manufacturers are lined up to help with later steps, including putting the vaccine into vials, in the U.S., Italy, Spain and South Africa.</p>
<p>In the scramble to create COVID-19 vaccines, the three Western drug makers who’ve dominated the vaccine industry for decades — Merck &amp; Co., Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline — surprisingly all fell short. Merck halted its own plans to develop a coronavirus vaccine earlier this year, finding that their candidates were generating an inferior immune system response compared with other vaccines. It said it would instead focus its work on developing treatments for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Now, amid the global clamor for more vaccine doses, those heavyweights are helping manufacture doses for less-experienced rivals whose vaccines won the first emergency authorizations from regulators.</p>
<p>Merck has since said it was in talks to help other drug companies with vaccine production, but wouldn’t say Tuesday whether other deals are imminent.</p>
<p>“Merck remains steadfast in our commitment to contribute to the global response to the pandemic and to preparing to address future pandemics,” the Kenilworth, New Jersey-based company said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — FBI Director Chris Wray condemned the January riot at the U.S. Capitol as “domestic terrorism” Tuesday as he defended the bureau’s handling of intelligence indicating the prospect for violence. He told lawmakers the information was properly shared with other law enforcement agencies even though it was raw and unverified.</p>
<p>Wray&#8217;s comments in his first public appearance before Congress since the deadly Capitol attack two months ago amounted to the FBI&#8217;s most vigorous defense against the suggestion that it had not adequately communicated to police agencies that there was a distinct possibility of violence as lawmakers were gathering to certify the results of the presidential election.</p>
<p>A Jan. 5 report from the FBI&#8217;s Norfolk, Virginia, field office warned of online posts foreshadowing a “war” in Washington the following day. However, Capitol Police leaders have said they were unaware of that report and had received no intelligence from the FBI that would have led them to expect the sort of violence that besieged the Capitol that day. Five people died that day.</p>
<p>Asked about the handling of the report, Wray told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday that it was shared though the FBI&#8217;s joint terrorism task force, discussed at a command post and posted on an Internet portal available to other law enforcement agencies. The information was raw and unverified, and ideally, the FBI would have had more time to try to corroborate it.</p>
<p>“Our folks made the judgment to get that to the relevant people as quickly as possible,” Wray said.</p>
<p>He was also expected to be pressed at the hearing on how the FBI is confronting a national security threat from <a href="https://apnews.com/article/6a19ebcf35353bb4e5644a2ee77bc83c">white nationalists</a> and domestic violent extremists and whether the bureau has adequate resources to address those issues.</p>
<p>The violence at the Capitol made clear that a law enforcement agency that remade itself after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to deal with international terrorism is now scrambling to address homegrown violence from white Americans. President Joe Biden&#8217;s administration has tasked his <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-biden-cabinet-cabinets-avril-haines-1baafcedcbf25c713c4251d307ecb306">national intelligence director</a> to work with the FBI and Department of Homeland Security to assess the threat.</p>
<p>“It’s behavior that we, the FBI, view as domestic terrorism. It’s got no place in our democracy and tolerating it would make a mockery of our nation’s rule of law,&#8221; Wray said of Jan. 6.</p>
<p>Wray has kept a notably low profile since the Capitol attack. Though he has briefed lawmakers privately and shared information with local law enforcement, Tuesday&#8217;s oversight hearing marked Wray&#8217;s first public appearance before Congress since before November&#8217;s presidential election.</p>
<p>Wray was also likely to face questions about the FBI&#8217;s investigation into <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-cybersecurity-hacks-solarwinds-4ae46954c9fd6cb881207d5384c2b250">a massive Russian hack</a> of corporations and U.S. government agencies, which happened when elite hackers injected malicious code into a software update.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Biden administration announced sanctions of Russian officials and businesses Tuesday for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/c7a5c4e5ff2ce454a0a99400e8016005">a nearly fatal nerve-agent attack</a> upon <a href="https://apnews.com/article/alexei-navalny-russia-explained-88c97b51172dbc0cff13f4d9e17b1f2a">opposition leader Alexei Navalny</a> and his subsequent jailing.</p>
<p>Senior administration officials did not immediately identify the Russian officials targeted but said some of them had been on a list of prominent business and political figures Navalny had urged the West to sanction, shortly before his latest arrest. The Biden administration also announced sanctions under the U.S. Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act for 13 businesses and another enterprise, most of which it said were involved in the production of biological and chemical agents.</p>
<p>The U.S. intelligence community concluded with high confidence that Russia&#8217;s Federal Security Service used <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-health-europe-international-news-758d55ae39ae54b007eead7691c2b890">the Russian nerve agent Novichok</a> on the dissident last August, a senior administration official said.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s sanctions would be the first of several steps by the Biden administration to “respond to a number of destabilizing actions,” said one of the administration officials, who briefed reporters on the condition they not be identified further.</p>
<p>The sanctions are the first against Russia by the Biden administration, which has pledged to confront President Vladimir Putin for alleged attacks on Russian opposition figures and any malign actions abroad, including the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-us-agency-hacking-a1d451df34d9f50ddb20f9df0c16b2ef">hacking of U.S. government agencies and U.S. businesses</a>. President Donald Trump spoke admiringly of Putin and resisted criticism of Putin&#8217;s government. That included dismissing U.S. intelligence <a href="https://apnews.com/article/d094918c0421b872eac7dc4b16e613c7">findings that Russia had backed Trump</a> in that country&#8217;s covert campaign to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden is not seeking either a reset of relations with Russia or an escalation against it, the U.S. official said. Rather, the U.S. intends to “hold Russia to account for its actions. It is also committed to working with Russia in areas that advance its interests.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Biden administration coordinated the sanctions with the European Union, which already had <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-europe-vladimir-putin-arrests-russia-be36cf3e8244b60a217735133887b1f0">imposed sanctions</a> against a small number of Russian officials in Navalny&#8217;s case.</p>
<p>Some rights groups previously faulted the EU for not targeting the most important Russian officials allegedly involved. The European bloc announced new sanctions Tuesday targeting high-ranking Russian officials over the attack and prosecution of Navalny, Putin’s most high-profile political foe.</p>
<p>The 27-nation bloc imposed bans on travel and froze the assets in Europe of Alexander Bastrykin, head of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation; Igor Krasnov, the prosecutor-general; Viktor Zolotov, head of the National Guard; and Alexander Kalashnikov, head of the Federal Prison Service.</p>
<p>The Biden administration had forecast for weeks actions against Russia. Besides the Navalny sanctions, officials have said the administration plans to respond soon to the massive Russian hack of federal government agencies and private corporations that laid bare vulnerabilities in the cyber supply chain and exposed potentially sensitive secrets to elite Kremlin spies.</p>
<p>Navalny, 44, was sickened by the Russian nerve agent in an attack that the United States and others linked to Putin’s security services. After months of recuperation in Germany, Navalny flew home to Moscow in January and was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/alexei-navalny-putin-russia-detained-74a87b440567673e55ea527980e472e1">arrested upon arrival</a> for an alleged parole violation.</p>
<p>His detention sparked <a href="https://apnews.com/article/world-news-russia-cb331fa15a10be0f368b153e09e1e0f0">street protests across Russia</a>. Police <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-moscow-coronavirus-pandemic-arrests-russia-085b16035e9c89ffb9919e4d94a2309c">arrested thousands</a> of demonstrators. Authorities have transferred the opposition leader to a penal colony to begin serving a sentence, after what rights groups said was a show trial.</p>
<p>Navalny, long a target in Russian government attempts to shut down dissent there, has repeatedly appealed to the West to start targeting the most powerful business and financial oligarchs of his country, saying only then would Russian leaders take international sanctions seriously.</p>
<p>Navalny, shortly before his latest, arrest gave supporters a list of eight big business and political figures he hoped the West would hit in new sanctions. The Biden administration official said some of those named by Navalny were among those in the new U.S. sanctions. The administration declined to immediately identify them. Further sanctions on other prominent Russians were possible, the official said.</p>
<p>The sanctions announced are the latest U.S. government effort to censure behavior by Russia that American officials see as having violated international norms.</p>
<p>In 2016, for instance, the Obama administration responded to interference by the Kremlin in the presidential election by expelling dozens of Russian diplomats who officials said were actually spies and by shuttering two Russian compounds in Maryland and New York.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s administration also took a handful of actions adverse to Moscow, including through the closure of Russian consulates on the West Coast and the suspension of a nuclear arms treaty.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ATLANTA (AP) — Vernon Jordan, who rose from humble beginnings in the segregated South to become a champion of civil rights before reinventing himself as a Washington insider and corporate influencer, has died, according to a statement from his daughter. He was 85.</p>
<p>“My father passed away last night around 10p surrounded by loved ones his wife and daughter by his side,” Jordan’s daughter, Vickee Jordan Adams, said in a statement released Tuesday to CBS News.</p>
<p>After stints as field secretary for the Georgia NAACP and executive director of the United Negro College Fund, he became head of the National Urban League, becoming the face of Black America’s modern struggle for jobs and justice for more than a decade. He was nearly killed by a racist’s bullet in 1980 before transitioning to business and politics.</p>
<p>His friendship with Bill Clinton took them both to the White House. Jordan was an unofficial Clinton aide, drawing him into controversy during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.</p>
<p>Jordan “never gave up on his friends or his country,&#8221; Clinton said Tuesday.</p>
<p>“From his instrumental role in desegregating the University of Georgia in 1961, to his work with the NAACP, the Southern Regional Council, the Voter Education Project, the United Negro College Fund, and the National Urban League, to his successful career in law and business, Vernon Jordan brought his big brain and strong heart to everything and everybody he touched. And he made them better,&#8221; Clinton and his wife Hillary said in a statement.</p>
<p>Former President Barack Obama said that “like so many others, Michelle and I benefited from Vernon Jordan’s wise counsel and warm friendship — and deeply admired his tireless fight for civil rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jordan&#8217;s death comes months after the deaths of two other civil rights icons: U.S. Rep. John Lewis and C.T. Vivian.</p>
<p>After growing up in the Jim Crow South and living much of his life in a segregated America, Jordan took a strategic view of race issues.</p>
<p>“My view on all this business about race is never to get angry, no, but to get even,” Jordan said in a July 2000 New York Times interview. “You don’t take it out in anger; you take it out in achievement.”</p>
<p>Jordan was the first lawyer to head the Urban League, which had traditionally been led by social workers. Under Jordan’s leadership, the Urban League added 17 more chapters and its budget swelled to more than $100 million. The organization also broadened its focus to include voter registration drives and conflict resolution between Blacks and law enforcement.</p>
<p>He resigned from the Urban League in 1982 to become a partner at Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer and Feld.</p>
<p>Jordan was a key campaign adviser to Clinton during his first presidential campaign and co-chaired Clinton’s transition team. He was the first Black to be assigned such a role.</p>
<p>Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday on Twitter that “Jordan&#8217;s leadership took our nation closer to its Founding promise: all are created equal.&#8221;</p>
<p>His friendship with Clinton, which began in the 1970s, evolved into a partnership and political alliance. He met Clinton as a young politician in Arkansas, and the two connected over their Southern roots and poor upbringings.</p>
<p>Although Jordan held held no official role in the Clinton White House, he was highly influential and had such labels as the “first friend.” He approached Colin Powell about becoming Secretary of State and encouraged Clinton to pass the NAFTA agreement in 1993. Jordan also secured a job at Revlon for Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern whose sexual encounters with the president spawned a scandal.</p>
<p>Jordan’s actions briefly drew the attention of federal prosecutors investigating Clinton’s actions, but he ultimately was not mentioned in a final report issued by special prosecutor Ken Starr.</p>
<p>Vernon Eulion Jordan Jr., was born in Atlanta on Aug. 15, 1935, the second of Vernon and Mary Belle Jordan’s three sons. Until Jordan was 13, the family lived in public housing. But he was exposed to Atlanta’s elite through his mother, who worked as a caterer for many of the city’s affluent citizens.</p>
<p>Jordan went to DePauw University in Indiana, where he was the only Black student in his class and one of five at the college. Distinguishing himself through academics, oratory and athletics, he graduated in 1957 with a bachelor’s degree in political science and went on to attend Howard University School of Law in Washington. While there, he married his first wife, Shirley Yarbrough.</p>
<p>The young couple moved to Atlanta after Jordan earned his law degree in 1960, and Jordan became a clerk for civil rights attorney Donald Hollowell, who successfully represented two Black students — Hamilton Holmes and Charlayne Hunter — attempting to integrate the University of Georgia. In an iconic photograph, Jordan, an imposing 6 feet, 4 inches, is seen holding at bay the white mob that tried to block Hunter from starting her first day of classes.</p>
<p>In 1961, Jordan became Georgia field secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. During his two years in the role, Jordan built new chapters, coordinated demonstrations and boycotted businesses that would not employ Blacks.</p>
<p>In a statement Tuesday, Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams said Jordan “battled the demons of voter suppression and racial degradation, winning more than he lost.”</p>
<p>“He brought others w/him. And left a map so more could find their way,&#8221; Abrams said on Twitter. “Love to his family. Travel on with God’s grace.”</p>
<p>Jordan moved to Arkansas in 1964 and went into private practice. He also became director of the Voter Education Project of the Southern Regional Council. During his tenure, millions of new Blacks joined the voter rolls and hundreds of Blacks were elected in the South.</p>
<p>Jordan considered running for Georgia’s fifth congressional district seat in 1970, but was tapped that year to head the United Negro College Fund. Holding the position for just 12 months, Jordan used his fundraising skills to fill the organization’s coffers with $10 million to help students at historically Black colleges and universities.</p>
<p>In 1971, after the death of Whitney Young Jr., Jordan was named the fifth president of the National Urban League, which is dedicated to empowering African Americans to enter the economic and social mainstream.</p>
<p>“I believe that working with the Urban League, the NAACP, PUSH and SCLC is the highest form of service that you can perform for Black people,” Jordan said in a December 1980 interview in Ebony Magazine. “And if you serve Black people you serve the country as well. So if I do a good job here, the Black people are not the only beneficiary; so is the country. The country has a vested interest in Black people doing well.”</p>
<p>The high-profile position landed him in the crosshairs of a racist in May 1980 in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Jordan was shot with a hunter’s rifle outside his hotel after returning from dinner following a speaking engagement.</p>
<p>Jordan had five surgeries and was visited by President Jimmy Carter during his 3-month recovery in the hospital.</p>
<p>“I’m not afraid and I won’t quit,” Jordan told Ebony after the shooting.</p>
<p>Joseph Paul Franklin, an avowed white supremacist who targeted Blacks and Jews in a cross-country killing spree from 1977 to 1980, later admitted to shooting Jordan. He was never prosecuted in Jordan’s case, but was put to death in 2013 for another slaying in Missouri.</p>
<p>Jordan left the organization in 1981, but said his departure was not related to the shooting.</p>
<p>In 2000, Jordan joined the New York investment firm of Lazard Freres &amp; Co. as a senior managing partner. The following year, he released an autobiography, “Vernon Can Read!: A Memoir.” Also in 2001, Jordan was awarded the Spingarn Medal, the highest honor given to a Black American for outstanding achievement.</p>
<p>He has received more than 55 honorary degrees, including ones from both of his alma maters and sat on several boards of directors.</p>
<p>“He became the model for boards of directors; sitting on countless boards,&#8221; The Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. said Tuesday on Twitter. “He became a renowned international lawyer. I miss him so much already.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats&#8217; hopes of including a minimum wage increase in their $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill seemed all but dead Monday as the Senate prepared to debate its own version of the House-passed aid package.</p>
<p>Four days after the chamber’s parliamentarian said Senate rules forbid inclusion of a straight-out minimum wage increase in the relief measure, Democrats seemed to have exhausted their most realistic options for quickly salvaging the pay hike. In one decision, they abandoned a potential amendment threatening tax increases on big companies that don&#8217;t boost workers’ pay to certain levels.</p>
<p>“At this moment, we may not have a path but I hope we can find one” for pushing the federal pay floor to $15 an hour, said No. 2 Senate Democratic leader Richard Durbin of Illinois.</p>
<p>Senate Democrats hope to unveil their version of the broad relief package and begin debate as early as Wednesday. Congressional leaders want to send President Joe Biden the legislation combating the pandemic and bolstering the economy by March 14, the date emergency jobless benefits that lawmakers approved in December expire.</p>
<p>The overall relief bill is Biden’s biggest early legislative priority. It looms as <a href="https://newsroom.ap.org/79588182fe7dea3093fb743c9c6b22ab">an initial test of his ability to unite Democrats </a>in the Senate — where the party has no votes to spare — and risks lasting damage to his influence should he fail. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-politics-pandemics-coronavirus-pandemic-barack-obama-07fec15628ceee80cb702089287d3aa4">Republicans are strongly against the legislation</a> and could well oppose it unanimously, as House GOP lawmakers did when that chamber approved the bill early Saturday.</p>
<p><a href="https://newsroom.ap.org/2409cc7b60e46ee9f9721b787dd7c623">The measure </a>would provide $1,400 payments to individuals plus hundreds of billions of dollars for schools and colleges, COVID-19 vaccines and testing, mass transit systems, renters and small businesses. It also has money for child care, tax breaks for families with children and assistance for states willing to expand Medicaid coverage for low-income residents.</p>
<p>Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said he wanted Democrats to ignore the parliamentarian&#8217;s ruling blocking the minimum wage increase. He also wants them to vote to eliminate filibusters — procedural delays that would take an unachievable 60 votes for Democrats to prevail.</p>
<p>Neither idea seemed to have the support among Democrats or the White House needed to succeed. But Sanders, the Senate&#8217;s lead sponsor of the hike to $15, said he&#8217;d force a vote on an amendment restoring the minimum wage increase anyway.</p>
<p>“This is the soul of the Democratic Party,” he said of the proposal. In an acknowledgement that his effort might fall short, he said, “If we fail in this legislation, I will be back” and offer it in the near future.</p>
<p>The Senate is divided 50-50 between the parties with Vice President Kamala Harris able to cast only tie-breaking votes. Democrats are employing a seldom-used procedure for the COVID-19 relief bill that will shield the measure from filibusters.</p>
<p>Biden discussed the relief bill Monday in a virtual meeting with nine Senate Democrats, including Joe Manchin of West Virginia, an opponent of the $15 hourly target. A White House statement said the group was “united in the goal of quickly passing a significant package that reflects the scope of the challenges our country is facing.”</p>
<p>Democrats, who will need unanimity to pass the legislation, are pushing for several changes in the House measure.</p>
<p>Manchin told reporters he wants the bill’s emergency unemployment benefits, set at $400 weekly by the House, to revert to the current $300 figure enacted in December. That is certain to be divisive and draw strong opposition from progressives.</p>
<p>He and Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., also said they want spending to be better “targeted,” which Manchin said meant “helping the people that need help the most.” Republicans have said the legislation is too costly and spends money needlessly.</p>
<p>Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, said he wants the bill&#8217;s $350 billion for state and local governments to specify minimum amounts for municipal governments and wants perhaps $50 billion to improve broadband coverage.</p>
<p>The parliamentarian ruled Monday that some House-approved provisions, which would provide billions to help some struggling pension plans and to help people who’ve lost jobs afford health insurance, could stay in the bill, according to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore.</p>
<p>The House-approved minimum wage language would gradually raise the federal floor to $15 an hour by 2025, more than double the $7.25 in place since 2009.</p>
<p>After the parliamentarian said that provision would have to be deleted, Sanders and Wyden said they were working on plans to increase taxes on large corporations that don&#8217;t meet certain levels for workers&#8217; pay.</p>
<p>But that plan was dropped, Democrats said Monday, with Sanders saying the proposal would have been too easy for employers to evade. It was always questionable whether pressuring companies with tax increases would have won enough Democratic support to survive, and the idea would have affected only a fraction of workers paid the minimum wage.</p>
<p>Raising the minimum wage has broad support among Democrats. But while it’s embraced passionately by the party’s progressives, at least two Senate moderates — Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona — have voiced opposition to including it in the broader relief measure, wounding its prospects and fostering tensions within the party.</p>
<p>Democrats must now decide “how we do minimum wage as part of another piece of legislation or on its own,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.</p>
<p>While eliminating filibusters or overruling the parliamentarian has strong support among progressives, the ideas lack appeal to moderates. They are wary of erasing procedures that the party has used in the past, and could use again, to protect its priorities when it is in the minority.</p>
<p>Among those who&#8217;ve long supported retaining the filibuster is Biden, who served nearly four decades in the Senate.</p>
<p>“The president’s view on the filibuster is well known. He has not changed that point of view,&#8221; White House press secretary Jen Psaki said pointedly Monday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Democrats are considering reshaping parts of the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill passed by the House, as party leaders hoping to salvage a minimum wage increase have abandoned one proposal aimed at pressuring big companies to boost workers&#8217; pay.</p>
<p>The chances seemed slim that Senate Democrats would find a way to include a minimum wage boost in the massive relief package, days after the nonpartisan parliamentarian said it violated the chamber&#8217;s rules and had to fall from the bill. Compared to that, most other changes the party was considering seemed modest.</p>
<p>Senate Democrats were hoping to unveil their own version of the relief package as early as Wednesday. Congressional leaders are trying to send President Joe Biden legislation combating the pandemic and bolstering the economy by March 14, the date emergency jobless benefits that lawmakers approved in December expire.</p>
<p>The legislation is Biden&#8217;s biggest early legislative priority and looms as a test of his ability to unite congressional Democrats that could cause lasting damage to his clout should it fail. Republicans are strongly against the legislation and could well oppose it unanimously, as House GOP lawmakers did when that chamber approved the bill early Saturday.</p>
<p>Last week, Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said they were working on plans to increase taxes on large corporations that don&#8217;t meet certain targets for workers&#8217; pay.</p>
<p>But three Senate aides, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions, said Monday that party leaders were dropping those proposals.</p>
<p>It was never clear that the idea had won enough support from Senate Democrats to survive. Democrats will need unanimous support to move the bill through the Senate, which is divided 50-50. Vice President Kamala Harris is the tiebreaking vote.</p>
<p>The White House did not embrace the proposals, and some House Democrats reacted coolly to the plan, which would have affected only a fraction of workers paid the minimum wage.</p>
<p>Raising the minimum wage has broad support among Democrats. But while it ranks as the No. 1 priority for the party&#8217;s progressives, at least two Senate moderates — Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona — have voiced opposition to including it in the relief measure, wounding its prospects and fostering tensions within the party.</p>
<p>The House-approved language would gradually raise the federal minimum to $15 an hour by 2025, more than double the $7.25 floor in place since 2009. Sanders is the chief Senate sponsor of the $15 plan, while Wyden is chair of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee.</p>
<p>Senate Democrats may reshape the $350 billion the bill provides for state and local governments. They also might extend its fresh round of emergency unemployment benefits, which would be $400 weekly, through September instead of August, as the House approved.</p>
<p>The bill also provides hundreds of billions of dollars for schools and colleges, COVID-19 vaccines and testing, assistance for mass transit systems and renters, and tax breaks for families with children or lower incomes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PARIS (AP) — A Paris court found French former President Nicolas Sarkozy guilty of corruption and influence peddling on Monday and sentenced him to a year in prison. He can ask to serve that time at home and also plans to appeal.</p>
<p>The 66-year-old, who was president from 2007 to 2012, was convicted of trying to bribe a magistrate in exchange for information about a legal case in which he was implicated.</p>
<p>He will remain free while he appeals, but it was a blow to the retired politician who still plays an influential role in French conservative politics. It&#8217;s not the end of his legal troubles either: He faces another trial later this month and is also under investigation in a third case.</p>
<p>The ruling marks the first time in France’s modern history that a former president has been convicted of corruption — and given a prison term. His predecessor, Jacques Chirac, was found guilty in 2011 of misuse of public money during his time as Paris mayor — not considered a corruption offense — and was given a two-year suspended prison sentence.</p>
<p>The court said Sarkozy is entitled to ask to be detained at home with an electronic bracelet — as is the case for any sentence of two years or less. He also received a two-year suspended sentence — which he will not have to serve if he commits no new offense in the next five years.</p>
<p>Later, Sarkozy’s lawyer, Jacqueline Laffont, said he would appeal.</p>
<p>Sarkozy’s co-defendants — his lawyer and longtime friend Thierry Herzog, 65, and now-retired magistrate Gilbert Azibert, 74 — were also found guilty and given the same sentence as the politician.</p>
<p>The court found that Sarkozy and his co-defendants sealed a “pact of corruption,” based on “consistent and serious evidence”.</p>
<p>The court said the case was “particularly serious” given that the acts were committed by a former president for his personal gain. In addition, as a lawyer by training, Sarkozy was “perfectly aware” that what he was doing was illegal, the court said.</p>
<p>Sarkozy did not deny offering to help Azibert get a job in Monaco — but he firmly refuted that he had done anything wrong during the 10-day trial at the end of last year.</p>
<p>Seated on a chair facing the judges and wearing a mask largely hiding his face, Sarkozy showed no reaction when the verdict was read out, and quickly left the courtroom.</p>
<p>“What insane harassment, my love,” his wife Carla Bruni said in a post on Instagram. “The fight goes on, truth will see the light.”</p>
<p>The trial focused on phone conversations that took place in February 2014.</p>
<p>At the time, investigative judges had launched an inquiry into the financing of Sarkozy&#8217;s 2007 presidential campaign. During the investigation, they discovered that Sarkozy and Herzog were communicating via secret mobile phones registered to the alias “Paul Bismuth.”</p>
<p>Wiretapped conversations on those phones led prosecutors to suspect Sarkozy and Herzog of promising Azibert a job in Monaco in exchange for leaking information about another legal case involving Sarkozy.</p>
<p>In one phone call with Herzog, Sarkozy said of Azibert: “I’ll make him move up. &#8230; I’ll help him.”</p>
<p>In another, Herzog reminded Sarkozy to “say a word” for Azibert during a trip to Monaco.</p>
<p>Azibert never got the Monaco job, and legal proceedings against Sarkozy have been dropped in the case he was seeking information about.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have concluded, however, that the “clearly stated promise” still constitutes corruption under French law, even if the promise wasn&#8217;t fulfilled.</p>
<p>Laffont, Sarkozy&#8217;s lawyer, argued the whole case was based on “idle chatter” between a lawyer and his client.</p>
<p>Sarkozy vigorously denied any malicious intention in his offer to help Azibert. He told the court that his political life was all about “giving (people) a little help. That all it is, a little help,&#8221; he said during the trial.</p>
<p>He also complained that the confidentiality of communications between a lawyer and his client was violated by the wiretaps.</p>
<p>“You have in front of you a man of whom more that 3,700 private conversations have been wiretapped. &#8230; What did I do to deserve that?” Sarkozy said during the trial.</p>
<p>The court concluded that the use of wiretapped conversations was legal as long as they helped show evidence of corruption-related offenses.</p>
<p>Sarkozy withdrew from active politics after failing to be chosen as his conservative party’s presidential candidate in France’s 2017 election, won by Emmanuel Macron.</p>
<p>He remains very popular amid conservative voters, however, and plays a major role behind the scenes, including through maintaining a relationship with Macron, whom he is said to advise on some issues. His memoirs published last year, “The Time of Storms,” was a bestseller for weeks.</p>
<p>Sarkozy will face the Paris court again later this month over suspicions regarding his 2012 presidential campaign, which ended in victory for Socialist rival Francois Hollande. His conservative party and a company named Bygmalion are accused of using a special invoice system to conceal allegedly spending 42.8 million euros ($50.7 million) — almost twice the maximum authorized.</p>
<p>In another investigation opened in 2013, Sarkozy is accused of having taken millions from then-Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi to illegally finance his successful 2007 campaign.</p>
<p>In both cases, he has denied wrongdoing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) &#8212; The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide whether it is unconstitutional to exclude people living in Puerto Rico from Supplemental Social Security Income.</p>
<p>The justices said they would hear an appeal, first filed by the Trump administration, of a lower-court ruling that held that residents of the U.S. territory should have the same access to SSI benefits as older, disabled and blind Americans in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>The administration argues that a pair of 40-year-old Supreme Court decisions already upheld the federal law that created SSI and excluded Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories from it. Congress later added in the Mariana Islands.</p>
<p>In recent months, a federal judge ruled that Puerto Rico residents should have access to other federal welfare benefits from which they have been excluded as well. A federal judge in Guam said residents of that Pacific island also should be able to collect SSI.</p>
<p>A separate program, Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled, covers residents of the territories, but it has more stringent eligibility requirements and pays less generous benefits than SSI.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) &#xE2;&#x80;&#x94; Taking the stage for the first time since leaving office, former President Donald Trump called for GOP unity, even as he exacerbated intraparty divisions by attacking fellow Republicans and promoting lies about the election in a speech that made clear he intends to remain a dominant political force.<p>Speaking Sunday at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he has been hailed as a returning hero, Trump blasted his successor, President Joe Biden, and tried to lay out a vision for the future of the GOP that revolves firmly around him, despite his loss in November.</p><p>&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;Do you miss me yet?&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D; Trump said after taking the stage to his old rally soundtrack and cheers from the supportive crowd.</p><p>Trump, in his speech, tried to downplay the civil war gripping the party over the extent to which Republicans should embrace him, even as he unfurled an enemies list, calling out by name the 10 House Republicans and seven GOP senators who voted to impeach or convict him for inciting the U.S. Capitol riot. He ended by singling out Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, who has faced tremendous backlash in Wyoming for saying Trump should no longer play a role in the party or headline the event.</p><div><embed type="oembed">https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1366166341544267776?s=20</embed></div><p>While he insisted the division was merely a spat &#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;between a handful of Washington, D.C., establishment political hacks and everybody else, all over the country,&#x201D; Trump had a message for the incumbents who had dared to cross him: &#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;Get rid of &#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;em all.&#x201D;</p><p>The conference, held this year in Orlando instead of the Washington suburbs to evade COVID-19 restrictions, served as a tribute to Trump and Trumpism, complete with a golden statue in his likeness on display. Speakers, including many potential 2024 hopefuls, argued that the party must embrace the former president and his followers, even after the deadly insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6.</p><p>They also repeated in panel after panel his unfounded claims that he lost reelection only because of mass voter fraud, even though such claims have been rejected by judges, Republican state officials and Trump&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;s own administration.</p><p>Trump, too, continued to repeat what Democrats have dubbed the &#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;big lie,&#x201D; calling the election &#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;rigged&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D; and insisting that he won in November, even though he lost by more than 7 million votes.</p><p>&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;As you know, they just lost the White House,&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D; he said of Biden, rewriting history.</p><p>It is highly unusual for past American presidents to publicly criticize their successors in the months after leaving office. Ex-presidents typically step out of the spotlight for at least a while; Barack Obama was famously seen kitesurfing on vacation after he departed, while George W. Bush said he believed Obama &#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;deserves my silence&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D; and took up painting.</p><p>Not Trump.</p><p>He delivered a sharp rebuke of what he framed as the new administration&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;s first month of failures, especially Biden&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;s approach to immigration and the border.</p><p>&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;Joe Biden has had the most disastrous first month of any president in modern history,&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D; Trump said.</p><p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki had brushed off the expected criticism last week. &#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;We&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;ll see what he says, but our focus is certainly not on what President Trump is saying at CPAC,&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D; she told reporters.</p><p>Aside from criticizing Biden, Trump used the speech to crown himself the future of the Republican Party, even as many leaders argue they must move in a new, less divisive direction after Republicans lost not just the White House, but both chambers of Congress.</p><p>Though Trump has flirted with the the idea of creating a third party, he pledged Sunday to remain part of &#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;our beloved&#x201D; GOP.</p><p>&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;I&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;m going to continue to fight right by your side. We&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;re not starting new parties,&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D; he said. &#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;We have the Republican Party. It&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;s going to be strong and united like never before.&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D; Yet Trump spent much of the speech lashing out at those he has deemed insufficiently loyal and dubbed &#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;RINOs&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D; &#xE2;&#x80;&#x94; Republican in name only &#xE2;&#x80;&#x94; for failing to stand with him.</p><p>&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;We cannot have leaders who show more passion for condemning their fellow Americans than they have ever shown for standing up to Democrats, the media and the radicals who want to turn America into a socialist country,&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D; Trump said.</p><p>Trump did not use his speech to announce plans to run again, but he repeatedly teased the prospect as he predicted a Republican would win back the White House in 2024.</p><p>&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;And I wonder who that will be,&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D; he offered. &#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;Who, who, who will that be? I wonder.&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D;</p><p>It remains unclear, however, how much appetite there would be for another Trump term, even in the room of staunch supporters.</p><p>The conference&#x2019;s annual unscientific straw poll of just over 1,000 attendees found that 97% approved of the job Trump did as president. But they were much more ambiguous when asked whether he should run again, with only 68% saying he should.</p><p>If the 2024 primary were held today and Trump were in the race, just 55% said they would vote for him, followed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis at 21%. Without Trump in the field, DeSantis garnered 43% support, followed by 8% for South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem and 7% each for former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.</p><p>While he no longer has his social media megaphone after being barred from Twitter and Facebook, Trump had been inching back into public life even before the speech. He called into conservative news outlets after talk radio star Rush Limbaugh&#x2019;s death and has issued statements, including one blasting Mitch McConnell after the Senate Republican leader excoriated Trump for inciting the Capitol riot. McConnell has since said he would &#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;absolutely&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D; support Trump if he were the GOP nominee in 2024.</p><p>At his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump has also been quietly meeting with aides and senior party leaders as he builds his post-presidential political operation. While he has already backed several pro-Trump candidates, including one challenging an impeachment supporter, aides have been working this past week to develop benchmarks for those seeking his endorsement to make sure the candidates are serious and have set up full-fledged political and fundraising organizations before he gets involved.</p><p>They are also planning a new super PAC that could raise unlimited amounts of money, though one aide cautioned they were still deciding whether to create a new entity or repurpose an existing America First super PAC.</p><p>Trump hinted at the effort Sunday, voicing his commitment to helping elect Republicans and calling on attendees to join him.</p><p>&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;I stand before you today to declare that the incredible journey we begun together &#x2026; is far from being over,&#x201D; he said.</p></p>

					<description><![CDATA[ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo acknowledged for the first time Sunday that some of his behavior with women &#8220;may have been...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo acknowledged for the first time Sunday that some of his behavior with women &#8220;may have been insensitive or too personal,” and said he would cooperate with a sexual harassment investigation led by the state’s attorney general.</p>
<p>In a statement released amid mounting criticism from within his own party, the Democrat maintained he had never inappropriately touched or propositioned anyone. But he said he had teased people about their personal lives in an attempt to be “playful.”</p>
<p>“I now understand that my interactions may have been insensitive or too personal and that some of my comments, given my position, made others feel in ways I never intended. I acknowledge some of the things I have said have been misinterpreted as an unwanted flirtation. To the extent anyone felt that way, I am truly sorry about that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Cuomo, one of America’s most prominent governors, is facing the most serious challenge of his decade in office following claims he sexually harassed at least two women who worked for him. Democrats in New York and around the nation aren’t rallying to his side, leaving him increasingly isolated from traditional allies.</p>
<p>His partial admission of wrongdoing came after a day of wrangling over who should investigate his workplace behavior.</p>
<p>By day&#8217;s end, Cuomo acquiesced to demands that Attorney General Letitia James control the inquiry.</p>
<p>James said she expected to receive a formal referral that would give her office subpoena power and allow her to deputize an outside law firm for &#8220;a rigorous and independent investigation.”</p>
<p>“This is not a responsibility we take lightly,” said James, a Democrat who has been, at times, allied with Cuomo but is independently elected and had emerged as a consensus choice to lead a probe.</p>
<p>Calls for an investigation mounted after a second former employee of Cuomo&#8217;s administration went public Saturday with harassment claims.</p>
<p>Charlotte Bennett, a low-level aide in the governor’s administration until November, told The New York Times Cuomo asked questions about her sex life, including whether she ever had sex with older men, and made other comments she interpreted as gauging her interest in an affair.</p>
<p>Her accusation came days after another former aide, Lindsey Boylan, a former economic development adviser, elaborated on harassment allegations she first made in December. Boylan said Cuomo subjected her to an unwanted kiss and comments about her appearance.</p>
<p>Cuomo, 63, said he had intended to be a mentor for Bennett, who is 25. He has denied Boylan&#8217;s allegations.</p>
<p>Over several hours Sunday, James and other leading party officials rejected two of Cuomo&#8217;s proposals for how an investigation might proceed.</p>
<p>Under his first plan, a retired federal judge picked by Cuomo, Barbara Jones, would have reviewed his workplace behavior. In the second proposal, announced Sunday morning in an attempt to appease legislative leaders, Cuomo asked James and the state’s chief appeals court judge, Janet DiFiore, to jointly appoint a lawyer to investigate and issue a public report.</p>
<p>James rejected both plans, demanding a formal referral giving her office authority to subpoena documents and witness testimony.</p>
<p>Many of the biggest names in New York politics lined up behind James.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, both Democrats, said they wanted the attorney general to handle the investigation. Republican leaders had, for days, called on James to launch a probe. On Sunday, Republican state Senate Minority Leader Robert Ortt called on Cuomo to resign.</p>
<p>New York’s two U.S. senators, Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, both said an independent investigation was essential.</p>
<p>“These allegations are serious and deeply concerning. As requested by Attorney General James, the matter should be referred to her office so that she can conduct a transparent, independent and thorough investigation with subpoena power,” Gillibrand said.</p>
<p>Cuomo&#8217;s statement that women had misinterpreted comments that were intended to be jokes was met with outrage from some people, who said he appeared to be blaming the women.</p>
<p>“Is it ‘playful’ to touch one’s employees’ legs &amp; kiss them on the lips against their will? Bc better men than A Cuomo have been fired for that,&#8221; tweeted former Fox News and NBC journalist Megyn Kelly, whose sexual harassment allegations against late Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes helped lead to his ouster.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki said President Joe Biden also supported an independent review that &#8220;should move forward as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>The furor comes amid a new round of criticism over Cuomo&#8217;s leadership style and actions his administration took to protect his reputation as a leader in the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Cuomo won praise as a strong hand during last spring’s crisis of rising case counts and overflowing morgues. His book, “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic,” was published in October.</p>
<p>But in recent weeks his administration was forced to revise its count of COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes following criticism that it had undercounted the fatalities to blunt accusations that some of his administration&#8217;s policies had made the situation worse.</p>
<p>James fueled some of that criticism by issuing a report saying the Cuomo administration had undercounted deaths.</p>
<p>Now, his support is eroding faster.</p>
<p>“Lindsey Boylan and Charlotte Bennett’s detailed accounts of sexual harassment by Gov. Cuomo are extremely serious and painful to read,” U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on Twitter Sunday. “There must be an independent investigation — not one led by an individual selected by the Governor, but by the office of the Attorney General.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ORLANDO (AP) — Less than six weeks after leaving office, former President Donald Trump will deliver the closing speech at a conservative conference Sunday as he reasserts himself on the national stage and makes clear he intends to remain a dominant force within the Republican Party.</p>
<p>Aides say Trump will use the speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference to blast his successor, President Joe Biden, and try to cement his status as the party’s undisputed leader going forward despite his loss in November.</p>
<p>“I stand before you today to declare that the incredible journey we began together four years ago is far from over,” Trump will say, according to excepts of his speech released early. “We are gathered this afternoon to talk about the future — the future of our movement, the future of our party, and the future of our beloved country.”</p>
<p>The event so far at a Hyatt hotel in Orlando, Florida, has been a tribute to Trump and Trumpism, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ted-cruz-elections-c5273f2cf5e1c478dd0d9b11b902bdf9">complete with a golden statue in his likeness.</a> Speakers, including many potential GOP 2024 hopefuls, have argued the party must embrace the former president and his followers, even after the deadly insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6. They stand in opposition to others who argue the party must move in a new, less divisive direction after Republicans lost not only the White House but both chambers of Congress in the last elections.</p>
<p>“The least popular (leaders) in our party are the ones who want to erase Donald Trump and Donald Trump’s supporters from our party,” said Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, the chair of the conservative Republican Study Committee, during a Saturday panel discussion. “And let me tell you, if that happens, we won&#8217;t win back the majority in 2022. We definitely won’t win back the White House in 2024 if we erase Donald Trump.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Biden, Trump is expected to deliver a sharp rebuke of what he will frame as the new administration&#8217;s first month of failures, including Biden&#8217;s approach to immigration and his decision to halt construction of Trump&#8217;s southern border wall, his foreign policy posture and his handling of the economy as the country continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>It is highly unusual for past American presidents to publicly criticize their successors so soon after leaving office. Ex-presidents typically step out of the spotlight for at least a while; Barack Obama was famously seen kitesurfing on vacation after he departed, while George W. Bush said he believed Obama “deserves my silence&#8221; and took up painting.</p>
<p>Not Trump.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki brushed off the expected criticism. “We’ll see what he says, but our focus is certainly not on what President Trump is saying at CPAC,&#8221; she told reporters.</p>
<p>Aside from criticizing Biden, Trump is expected to use the speech to discuss the future of the Republican Party and his “America First” movement, arguing they must stick with him to keep the new voters he brought into the party energized. And he will argue the only divide in the party is between Washington elites and the conservative grassroots, even as he seeks to punish those he has deemed insufficiently loyal, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and the No. 3 House Republican, Rep. Liz Cheney.</p>
<p>Indeed, on Friday, Trump began his vengeance campaign, endorsing Max Miller, a former aide who is seeking to oust Ohio Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, who voted in favor of Trump&#8217;s impeachment.</p>
<p>While he no longer has his social media megaphone after being barred from Twitter and Facebook, Trump has already been inching back into public life. He called into conservative news outlets after Rush Limbaugh&#8217;s death and to wish Tiger Woods well after the pro golfer was injured in a car crash. He has also issued statements, including one blasting McConnell after the Senate Republican leader excoriated Trump for inciting the Capitol riot. McConnell has since said he would “absolutely” support Trump if he were the GOP nominee in 2024.</p>
<p>At his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump has been quietly meeting with aides and senior party leaders as he builds his post-presidential political operation. While he has already endorsed several pro-Trump candidates, aides have been working this past week to develop benchmarks for those seeking his endorsement to make sure the candidates are serious and have set up full-fledged political and fundraising organizations before he gets involved.</p>
<p>They are also planning a new super PAC that could raise unlimited amounts of money, though one aide cautioned they were still deciding whether to create a new entity or repurpose an existing America First super PAC.</p>
<p>Trump is not expected to announce Sunday that he will run again in 2024, but allies made clear he would continue to float the prospect.</p>
<p>“You are going to see a speech on Sunday that talks about not only the beginning but what the future may look like,&#8221; Trump’s former chief of staff Mark Meadows told Fox News Channel&#8217;s Sean Hannity earlier this week. “What we will see on Sunday is we will see the start of planning for the next administration. And I can tell you, the people that are in the top of that list, all of &#8217;em have Trump as their last name.&#8221;</p>
<p>“I imagine it will not be what we call a ‘low-energy’ speech,” said Trump&#8217;s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., during his own speech on Friday to CPAC — or “T-PAC” as he called it. &#8220;I assure you that it will solidify Donald Trump and all of your feelings about the MAGA movement as the future of the Republican Party.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Virginia lawmakers gave final approval Saturday to a bill that will legalize marijuana for adult recreational use, but not until 2024, when retail sales of the drug would also begin.</p>
<p>With a compromise bill clearing the House and Senate, Virginia becomes the first Southern state to vote to legalize marijuana, joining 15 other states and the District of Columbia. The legislation now goes to Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, who supports legalization.</p>
<p>The bill was a top priority for Democrats, who framed legalization as a necessary step to end the disparate treatment of people of color under current marijuana laws. But talks between Democrats in the House and Senate grew tense in recent days, and a compromise version of the massive bill did not emerge publicly until late Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>“It’s been a lot of work to get here, but I would say that we’re on the path to an equitable law allowing responsible adults to use cannabis,&#8221; said Sen. Adam Ebbin, the chief sponsor of the Senate bill. He said the compromise agreement is a good start.</p>
<p>Several Democrats said they hoped Northam would send the legislation back to them with amendments, including speeding up the date for legalization.</p>
<p>Under the legislation that passed, possession of up to an ounce (28.3 grams) of marijuana will become legal beginning Jan. 1, 2024, at the same time sales will begin and regulations will go into effect to control the marijuana marketplace in Virginia.</p>
<p>Under a provision Senate Democrats insisted on, the legislation will include a reenactment clause that will require a second vote from the General Assembly, but only on the regulatory framework and criminal penalties for several offenses, including underage use and public consumption of marijuana. A second vote will not be required on legalization.</p>
<p>The Senate had sought to legalize simple possession this year to immediately end punishments for people with small amounts of marijuana, but House Democrats argued that legalization without a legal market for marijuana could promote the growth of the black market.</p>
<p>Lawmakers last year decriminalized marijuana, making simple possession a civil penalty that can be punished by a fine of no more than $25.</p>
<p>The three-year delay in legalizing simple possession drew sharp criticism from some lawmakers, as well as the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, Marijuana Justice and other racial justice advocacy groups.</p>
<p>“This bill does not advance the cause of equal justice or racial justice in Virginia. It is the product of a closed-door legislative process that has prioritized the interests of recreational marijuana smokers over people and communities of color,” the groups said in a statement before the vote.</p>
<p>Groups that opposed legalization entirely have said they are concerned that it could result in an increase in drug-impaired driving crashes and the use of marijuana among youth.</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers spoke against the measure Saturday night, saying such a critical issue deserved a less rushed approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say there are not more than two or three members of this body that have a clue about the comprehensiveness of what this bill does,&#8221; said Senate Minority Leader Tommy Norment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Coronavirus, budget questions, anti-riot legislation and an attempt to reign in large technology companies will be among issues lawmakers will take...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Coronavirus, budget questions, anti-riot legislation and an attempt to reign in large technology companies will be among issues lawmakers will take up in their 60-day session that begins Tuesday.</p>
<p>But so will bicycle seats, alcohol-to-go and baby boxes.</p>
<p>More than 2,500 bills have been filed ahead of the 2021 session. While most won’t pass, the Legislature will be grappling with a wide variety of issues under new Republican leaders, House Speaker Chris Sprowls and Senate President Wilton Simpson, all while figuring out how to do business in a pandemic.</p>
<p>The budget is the only bill lawmakers are required to pass, and lawmakers won’t get the latest revenue estimates until after session starts. One factor they won&#8217;t consider is potential federal COVID-19 relief money.</p>
<p>“We were being told at the end of last year the federal government is going to bring in money for the state governments, and they didn’t. I don’t think you can depend on Washington to do anything right. A lot of clowns in Washington and they don’t get a lot done,” said Simpson.</p>
<p>Gov. Ron DeSantis proposed a $96.6 billion for the fiscal year that begins July 1, or $4.3 billion more than the current budget. That might be overly optimistic considering the financial hit Florida has taken during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“It’s just not feasible, it’s not realistic and, most importantly, it’s not going to happen,” said Democratic Rep. Evan Jenne, a member of the House Appropriations Committee.</p>
<p>Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Kelli Stargel also said it will be a tough budget year.</p>
<p>“While we have all been relieved to see revenue collections come in over estimate in recent months, it is important to remember our starting point for planning for this budget was a $2.7 billion shortfall,” said Stargel, a Republican. “Modest gains do not negate the challenge before us. Reductions will be necessary.”</p>
<p>A priority for DeSantis, Sprowls and Simpson is passing protections for businesses and health care facilities that would shield them from COVID-19 lawsuits.</p>
<p>“What our bill says is, ’Look, if you’re trying to do the right thing, if you’re following guidelines by the state or the CDC, we want to make sure that you have a sense of financial security,” Sprowls said.</p>
<p>The speaker says he wants the protections to be the first legislation to pass, along with a bill that would make it a felony to profit off a pandemic by making false or misleading marketing claims about personal protective equipment or the availability or access to a vaccine.</p>
<p>Another priority for DeSantis and Republican leaders is a so-called anti-riot bill that would enhance penalties for crimes committed during a violent protest, not allow people arrested during such a demonstration to be released from jail before a first court appearance and create new felonies for organizing or participating in a violent demonstration.</p>
<p>DeSantis proposed the idea after a summer of protests held around the country to call attention to police violence against African Americans. But he has since pointed to the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol as a reason to support it.</p>
<p>Still, Democrats say he’s trying to squash the voice of groups like Black Lives Matter.</p>
<p>“This law would disproportionately hurt communities of color trying to exercise their constitutional rights,” said Democratic Rep. Dianne Hart. “This will give bad actors in law enforcement and the criminal justice system additional weapons to harm, incarcerate and kill Black and brown Floridians.”</p>
<p>Republican leaders will also target large technology companies like Twitter, Facebook and Amazon. DeSantis calls them “Big Tech cartels” that manipulate consumers and censor conservative politicians and ideologies. He and other Republicans point to then-President Donald Trump being banned from social media, and Amazon shutting down the conservative social media site Parler.</p>
<p>“Big Tech has come to look more like Big Brother with each passing day,” DeSantis said at a recent news conference. “But this is 2021, not 1984, and this is real life, not George Orwell’s fiction.”</p>
<p>Beyond leaders&#8217; priorities, there are hundreds of other bill covering a wide variety of topics. One would permanently allow restaurants to sell alcohol with delivered or take-out meals. DeSantis allowed the practice to help restaurants during the pandemic.</p>
<p>A number of bills involve children, like one that would increase the time parents can surrender an infant from one week to one month. It also would allow “baby boxes” at some fire stations and hospitals so parents can drop off infants without doing so face-to-face.</p>
<p>Two child safety bills would require child care facilities to install alarms in vans so drivers can check to make sure no children are left inside and raise the age children must be in booster seats from 5 to 6.</p>
<p>Among more obscure bills is an effort to amend a law that makes it illegal to ride a bike without a seat. Violators face a $15 fine. It would make an exception for elliptical bikes and others that are manufactured to be used without a seat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden said Friday that Iran should view his decision to authorize U.S. airstrikes in Syria as a warning that it can expect consequences for its support of militia groups that threaten U.S. interests or personnel.</p>
<p>“You can&#8217;t act with impunity. Be careful,” Biden said when a reporter asked what message he had intended to send with the airstrikes, which the Pentagon said destroyed several buildings in eastern Syria but were not intended to eradicate the militia groups that used them to facilitate attacks inside Iraq.</p>
<p>Administration officials defended the Thursday night airstrikes as legal and appropriate, saying they took out facilities that housed valuable “capabilities” used by Iranian-backed militia groups to attack American and allied forces in Iraq.</p>
<p>John Kirby, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, said members of Congress were notified before the strikes as two Air Force F-15E aircraft launched seven missiles, destroying nine facilities and heavily damaging two others, rendering both “functionally destroyed.” He said the facilities, at “entry control points” on the border, had been used by militia groups the U.S. deems responsible for recent attacks against U.S. interests in Iraq.</p>
<p>In a political twist for the new Democratic administration, several leading Congress members in Biden&#8217;s own party denounced the strikes, which were the first military actions he authorized. Democrats said the airstrikes were done without authorization from lawmakers, while Republicans were more supportive.</p>
<p>“Offensive military action without congressional approval is not constitutional absent extraordinary circumstances,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. And Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said lawmakers must hold the current administration to the same standards as any other. “Retaliatory strikes not necessary to prevent an imminent threat,” he said, must get congressional authorization.</p>
<p>But Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, backed the decision as “the correct, proportionate response to protect American lives.”</p>
<p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Friday that Biden used his constitutional authority to defend U.S. personnel.</p>
<p>&#8220;The targets were chosen to correspond to the recent attacks on facilities and to deter the risk of additional attacks over the coming weeks,” she said.</p>
<p>Among the recent attacks cited was a Feb. 15 rocket attack in northern Iraq that killed one civilian contractor and wounded a U.S. service member and other coalition troops.</p>
<p>At the Pentagon, Kirby said the operation was “a defensive strike” on a waystation used by militants to move weapons and materials for attacks into Iraq. But he noted that while it sent a message of deterrence and eroded their ability to strike from that compound, the militias have other sites and capabilities. He said the strikes resulted in “casualties” but declined to provide further details on how many were killed or injured and what was inside the buildings pending the completion of a broader assessment of damage inflicted.</p>
<p>An Iraqi militia official said Friday that the strikes killed one fighter and wounded several others.</p>
<p>Kirby said the facilities hit in the attack were near Boukamal, on the Syrian side of the Iraq border, along the Euphrates River.</p>
<p>“This location is known to facilitate Iranian-aligned militia group activity,” he said. He described the site as a “compound” that previously had been used by the Islamic State group when it held sway in the area.</p>
<p>The Iraqi militia official told The Associated Press that the strikes against the Kataeb Hezbollah, or Hezbollah Brigades, hit an area along the border between the Syrian site of Boukamal facing Qaim on the Iraqi side. The official was not authorized to speak publicly of the attack and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters Thursday evening shortly after the airstrikes were carried out, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said, “I’m confident in the target that we went after. We know what we hit.”</p>
<p>Biden’s decision to attack in Syria did not appear to signal an intention to widen U.S. military involvement in the region but rather to demonstrate a will to defend U.S. troops in Iraq and send a message to Iran. The Biden administration in its first weeks has emphasized its intent to put more focus on the challenges posed by China, even as Mideast threats persist.</p>
<p>The U.S. has previously targeted facilities in Syria belonging to Kataeb Hezbollah, which it has blamed for numerous attacks targeting U.S. personnel and interests in Iraq. The Iraqi Kataeb is separate from the Lebanese Hezbollah movement.</p>
<p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based group that monitors the war in Syria, said the strikes targeted a shipment of weapons that were being taken by trucks entering Syrian territories from Iraq. The group said 22 fighters from the Popular Mobilization Forces, an Iraqi umbrella group of mostly Shiite paramilitaries that includes Kataeb Hezbollah, were killed. The report could not be independently verified.</p>
<p>In a statement, the group confirmed one of its fighters was killed and said it reserved the right to retaliate, without elaborating. Kataeb Hezbollah, like other Iranian-backed factions, maintains fighters in Syria to both fight against the Islamic State group and assist Syrian President Bashar Assad&#8217;s forces in that country&#8217;s civil war.</p>
<p>Austin said he was confident the U.S. had hit back at “the same Shia militants” that carried out the Feb.1 5 rocket attack in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>Kirby credited Iraqis with providing valuable intelligence that allowed the U.S. to identify the groups responsible for attacks earlier this year. The U.S., he said, then determined the appropriate target for the retaliatory strike. He said the U.S. also notified Russia shortly before the strike as part of the ongoing deconfliction process of military activities in Syria.</p>
<p>“The operation sends an unambiguous message: President Biden will act to protect American and coalition personnel,” Kirby said.</p>
<p>Syria condemned the U.S. strike, calling it “a cowardly and systematic American aggression,” warning that the attack will lead to consequences.</p>
<p>U.S. forces have been significantly reduced in Iraq to 2,500 personnel and no longer partake in combat missions with Iraqi forces in ongoing operations against the Islamic State group.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(CNN) &#8212; The FBI has identified a suspect it&#8217;s focusing on in the death of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, according to law enforcement officials.</p>
<p>The theory, as CNN has reported, is that Sicknick became ill from bear spray used by the mob that attacked the Capitol on January 6, and video evidence CNN previously reported on appears to show the attack that could have caused his death.</p>
<p>It remains a difficult case for investigators and it&#8217;s not clear what charge they will be able to bring.</p>
<p>In a statement late Friday, the US Capitol Police noted that the medical examiner&#8217;s report on Sicknick&#8217;s death wasn&#8217;t finished yet: &#8220;We are awaiting toxicology results and continue to work with other government agencies regarding the death investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Officer Sicknick&#8217;s family has asked for privacy during this difficult time and that the spreading of misinformation stop regarding the cause of his death,&#8221; the statement said. &#8220;The Department and the Sicknick family appreciate the outpouring of support for our fallen officer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The New York Times first reported that investigators have zeroed in on one suspect, but have yet to identify the assailant by name.</p>
<p>CNN previously reported that authorities had winnowed it down to a handful of suspects and that new video evidence from the attack helped investigators narrow it down.</p>
<p>In police audio played at former President Donald Trump&#8217;s Senate impeachment trial, officers could be heard screaming during the attack that some members of the violent Capitol mob were spraying them with bear spray. Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah told reporters at the time that Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman, who potentially saved the senator from encountering the mob, had indicated to Romney that &#8220;he had to breathe a lot of bear spray and tear gas and that he was nauseated&#8221; while serving on January 6. The pair had spoken during a break in the trial.</p>
<p>Investigators have struggled for weeks to build a federal murder case in Sicknick&#8217;s death as they pored over video and photographs to try to determine the moment in which he suffered his fatal injuries. Investigators determined that initial reports suggesting Sicknick had been struck with a fire extinguisher weren&#8217;t true, CNN previously reported.</p>
<p>Several people have been charged with assaulting police officers in the weeks since the attack, but none so far in relation to Sicknick. More than 100 other police officers were injured in the melee last month, including at least 15 who required hospitalization, according to court documents.</p>
<p>Sicknick&#8217;s body lay in honor at the Capitol in an emotional ceremony early this month, during which President Joe Biden, first lady Jill Biden and congressional leaders paid visits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — A conference dedicated to the future of the conservative movement turned into an ode to Donald Trump as speakers declared their fealty to the former president and attendees posed for selfies with a golden statue of his likeness.</p>
<p>As the Republican Party grapples with deep divisions over the extent to which it should embrace Trump after losing the White House and both chambers of Congress, those gathered at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday made clear they are not ready to move on from the former president — or from his baseless charges that the November election was rigged against him.</p>
<p>“Donald J. Trump ain’t going anywhere,” said Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, one of several potential 2024 presidential contenders who spoke at the event, being held this year in Orlando to bypass COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
<p>Trump on Sunday will be making his first post-presidential appearance at the conference, and aides say he will use the speech to reassert his power.</p>
<p>The program underscored the split raging within the GOP, as many establishment voices argue the party must move on from Trump to win back the suburban voters who abandoned them in November, putting President Joe Biden in the White House. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and others worry Trump will undermine the party’s political future if he and his conspiracy theories continue to dominate Republican politics.</p>
<p>But at the conference, speakers continued to fan disinformation and conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, with panels dedicated to amplifying false claims of mass voter fraud that have been dismissed by the courts, state election officials and Trump’s own administration.</p>
<p>Indeed, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., another potential 2024 hopeful, drew among the loudest applause and a standing ovation when he bragged about challenging the election certification on Jan. 6 despite the storming of the Capitol building by Trump supporters trying to halt the process.</p>
<p>“I thought it was an important stand to take,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Others argued the party would lose if it turned its back on Trump and alienated the working-class voters drawn to his populist message.</p>
<p>“We cannot — we will not — go back to the days of the failed Republican establishment of yesteryear,” said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who outlined a new Trumpian GOP agenda focused on restrictive immigration policies, opposition to China and limiting military engagement.</p>
<p>“We will not win the future by trying to go back to where the Republican Party used to be,” echoed Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who chairs the fundraising committee tasked with electing Republicans to the Senate. “If we do, we will lose the working base that President Trump so animated. We’re going to lose elections across the country, and ultimately we’re going to lose our nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott is dismissing pressure on him to “mediate between warring factions on the right” or “mediate the war of words between the party leaders.&#8221; He has refused to take sides in the bitter ongoing fight between Trump and McConnell, who blamed Trump for inciting the deadly Capitol riot but ultimately voted to acquit him at his impeachment trial earlier this month.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to mediate anything,&#8221; he said, criticizing those who “prefer to fan the flames of a civil war on our side” as “foolish” and “ridiculous.&#8221;</p>
<p>But in speeches throughout the day, the GOP turmoil was front and center. Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., lit into Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, who has faced tremendous backlash for her vote to impeach Trump for inciting the Capitol riot.</p>
<p>And as the program was wrapping up, Trump issued a statement endorsing Max Miller, a former staffer who has now launched a campaign challenging Ohio Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, another Republican who voted in favor of impeachment.</p>
<p>Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former Fox News Channel host and Trump Jr.&#8217;s girlfriend, offered a pointed message to those who stand in opposition to the former president, who will not arrive at the conference until Sunday but was present in spirit in the form of a large golden statue erected in a merchandise show booth, where attendees could pose for pictures with it.</p>
<p>“We bid a farewell to the weak-kneed, the spineless and the cowards that are posing in D.C. pretending that they’re working for the people,” she said. “Let’s send them a pink slip straight from CPAC.”</p>
<p>Trump Jr., who labeled the conference “TPAC” in honor of his father, hyped the return of his father and the “Make America Great Again” platform to the spotlight.</p>
<p>“I imagine it will not be what we call a ‘low-energy’ speech,&#8221; he said. “And I assure you that it will solidify Donald Trump and all of your feelings about the MAGA movement as the future of the Republican Party.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The House approved a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill that was championed by President Joe Biden, the first step in providing another dose of aid to a weary nation as the measure now moves to a tense Senate.</p>
<p>“We have no time to waste,” Biden said at the White House after the House passage early Saturday. &#8220;We act now — decisively, quickly and boldly — we can finally get ahead of this virus. We can finally get our economy moving again. People in this country have suffered far too much for too long.”</p>
<p>The new president’s vision for infusing cash across a struggling economy to individuals, businesses, schools, states and cities battered by COVID-19 passed on a near party-line 219-212 vote. That ships the bill to the Senate, where Democrats seem bent on resuscitating their minimum wage push and fights could erupt over state aid and other issues.</p>
<p>Democrats said that mass unemployment and the half-million American lives lost are causes to act despite nearly $4 trillion in aid already spent fighting the fallout from the disease. GOP lawmakers, they said, were out of step with a public that polling finds largely views the bill favorably.</p>
<p>“I am a happy camper tonight,&#8221; Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said Friday. “This is what America needs. Republicans, you ought to be a part of this. But if you&#8217;re not, we&#8217;re going without you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Republicans said the bill was too expensive and said too few education dollars would be spent quickly to immediately reopen schools. They said it was laden with gifts to Democratic constituencies like labor unions and funneled money to Democratic-run states they suggested didn&#8217;t need it because their budgets had bounced back.</p>
<p>“To my colleagues who say this bill is bold, I say it&#8217;s bloated,&#8221; said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. “To those who say it&#8217;s urgent, I say it&#8217;s unfocused. To those who say it&#8217;s popular, I say it is entirely partisan.”</p>
<p>The overall relief bill would provide $1,400 payments to individuals, extend emergency unemployment benefits through August and increase tax credits for children and federal subsidies for health insurance.</p>
<p>It also provides billions for schools and colleges, state and local governments, COVID-19 vaccines and testing, renters, food producers and struggling industries like airlines, restaurants, bars and concert venues.</p>
<p>Moderate Democratic Reps. Jared Golden of Maine and Kurt Schrader of Oregon were the only two lawmakers to cross party lines. That sharp partisan divide is making the fight a showdown over whom voters will reward for heaping more federal spending to combat the coronavirus and revive the economy atop the $4 trillion approved last year.</p>
<p>The battle is also emerging as an early test of Biden&#8217;s ability to hold together his party&#8217;s fragile congressional majorities — just 10 votes in the House and an evenly divided 50-50 Senate.</p>
<p>At the same time, Democrats were trying to figure out how to assuage liberals who lost their top priority in a jarring Senate setback Thursday.</p>
<p>That chamber&#8217;s nonpartisan parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, said Senate rules require that a federal minimum wage increase would have to be dropped from the COVID-19 bill, leaving the proposal on life support. The measure would gradually lift that minimum to $15 hourly by 2025, doubling the current $7.25 floor in effect since 2009.</p>
<p>Hoping to revive the effort in some form, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is considering adding a provision to the Senate version of the COVID-19 relief bill that would penalize large companies that don&#8217;t pay workers at least $15 an hour, said a senior Democratic aide who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations.</p>
<p>That was in line with ideas floated Thursday night by Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a chief sponsor of the $15 plan, and Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden, D-Ore., to boost taxes on corporations that don&#8217;t hit certain minimum wage targets.</p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., offered encouragement, too, calling a minimum wage increase “a financial necessity for our families, a great stimulus for our economy and a moral imperative for our country.” She said the House would “absolutely&#8221; approve a final version of the relief bill because of its widespread benefits, even if it lacked progressives’ treasured goal.</p>
<p>While Democratic leaders were eager to signal to rank-and-file progressives and liberal voters that they would not yield on the minimum wage fight, their pathway was unclear because of GOP opposition and questions over whether they had enough Democratic support.</p>
<p>House Ways and Means Committee Chair Richard Neal, D-Mass., sidestepped a question on taxing companies that don&#8217;t boost pay, saying of Senate Democrats, “I hesitate to say anything until they decide on a strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Progressives were demanding that the Senate press ahead anyway on the minimum wage increase, even if it meant changing that chamber&#8217;s rules and eliminating the filibuster, a tactic that requires 60 votes for a bill to move forward.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have to reform the filibuster because we have to be able to deliver,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash.</p>
<p>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., another high-profile progressive, also said Senate rules must be changed, telling reporters that when Democrats meet with their constituents, &#8220;We can’t tell them that this didn’t get done because of an unelected parliamentarian.”</p>
<p>Traditionalists of both parties — including Biden, who served as a senator for 36 years — have opposed eliminating filibusters because they protect parties&#8217; interests when they are in the Senate minority. Biden said weeks ago that he didn&#8217;t expect the minimum wage increase to survive the Senate&#8217;s rules. Democrats narrowly hold Senate control.</p>
<p>Pelosi, too, seemed to shy away from dismantling Senate procedures, saying, “We will seek a solution consistent with Senate rules, and we will do so soon.”</p>
<p>The House COVID-19 bill includes the minimum wage increase, so the real battle over its fate will occur when the Senate debates its version over the next two weeks.</p>
<p>Democrats are pushing the relief measure through Congress under special rules that will let them avoid a Senate GOP filibuster, meaning that if they are united they won&#8217;t need any Republican votes.</p>
<p>It also lets the bill move faster, a top priority for Democrats who want the bill on Biden&#8217;s desk before the most recent emergency jobless benefits end on March 14.</p>
<p>But those same Senate rules prohibit provisions with only an “incidental” impact on the federal budget because they are chiefly driven by other policy purposes. MacDonough decided that the minimum wage provision failed that test.</p>
<p>Republicans oppose the $15 minimum wage target as an expense that would hurt businesses and cost jobs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — A $1.9 trillion package aimed at helping the country rebuild from the pandemic seemed headed toward House passage Friday, even as Democrats searched for a way to revive their derailed drive to boost the minimum wage.</p>
<p>A virtual party-line House vote was expected on the COVID-19 relief measure, which embodies President Joe Biden&#8217;s push to flush cash to individuals, businesses, states and cities. The White House issued a statement reinforcing its support for the new president&#8217;s paramount initial goal.</p>
<p>“The bill would allow the administration to execute its plan to change the course of the COVID-19 pandemic,&#8221; it said. “And it would provide Americans and their communities an economic bridge through the crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Republicans have lined up against the plan, calling it an overpriced and wasteful attempt to help Democratic allies like labor unions and Democratic-run states.</p>
<p>The bill is “a partisan circus” designed to “quickly notch some wins for the president&#8217;s buddies,” said Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., top Republican on the House Budget Committee.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s making the fight a showdown over which party voters will reward for approving added federal spending to combat the coronavirus and revive the economy, on top of $4 trillion previously passed. The pandemic has killed a half-million Americans, thrown millions out of work and reconfigured the daily lives of nearly everyone from coast to coast.</p>
<p>The battle is also emerging as an early test of Biden&#8217;s ability to hold together his party&#8217;s fragile congressional majorities — just 10 votes in the House and an evenly divided 50-50 Senate.</p>
<p>At the same time, Democrats were trying to figure out how to respond to Thursday night&#8217;s jarring setback in the Senate.</p>

<p>But while top Democrats were eager to signal to rank-and-file progressives and liberal voters that they would keep fighting to boost the minimum wage, the idea of prodding companies to boost pay with threatened tax increases faced an uncertain fate.</p>
<p>Many Democrats will likely to be reluctant to give eager Republicans ammunition for their decades-old charge that Democrats love raising taxes.</p>
<p>House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., sidestepped a question on whether he&#8217;d support taxing companies that don&#8217;t boost pay, saying of Senate Democrats, “I hesitate to to say anything until they decide on a strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p>But progressives were demanding that the Senate press ahead anyway on the minimum wage boost, even if it meant changing that chamber&#8217;s rules and eliminating the filibuster, a tactic that requires 60 votes for a bill to move forward.</p>

<p>But those same Senate rules prohibit provisions with only an “incidental” impact on the federal budget because they are chiefly driven by other policy purposes. MacDonough decided that the minimum wage provision failed that test, according to aides who described her decision on condition of anonymity because it hadn’t been publicly released.</p>
<p>Republicans oppose the $15 minimum wage target as an expense that would hurt businesses and cost jobs.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[HOUSTON (AP) — President Joe Biden heard firsthand from Texans clobbered by this month&#8217;s brutal winter weather on Friday and pledged to stick with them...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HOUSTON (AP) — President Joe Biden heard firsthand from Texans clobbered by this month&#8217;s brutal winter weather on Friday and pledged to stick with them “for the long haul” as he made his first trip to a major disaster area since he took office.</p>
<p>Biden was briefed by emergency officials and thanked workers for doing “God&#8217;s work.” He promised the federal government will be there for Texans as they try to recover, not just from the historic storm but also the public health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>“When a crisis hits our states, like the one that hit Texas, it’s not a Republican or Democrat that’s hurting,&#8221; Biden said. “It&#8217;s our fellow Americans that are hurting and it&#8217;s our job to help everyone in need.&#8221;</p>
<p>With tens of thousands of Houston area residents without safe water, local officials told Biden that many are still struggling. While he was briefed, first lady Jill Biden joined an assembly line of volunteers packing boxes of quick oats, juice, and other food at the Houston Food Bank, where he arrived later.</p>
<p>The president&#8217;s first stop was the Harris County Emergency Operations Center for a briefing from acting FEMA Administrator Bob Fenton and state and local emergency management officials.</p>
<p>Texas was hit particularly hard by the Valentine&#8217;s weekend storm that battered multiple states. Unusually frigid conditions led to widespread power outages and frozen pipes that burst and flooded homes. Millions of residents lost heat and running water.</p>
<p>At least 40 people in Texas died as a result of the storm and, although the weather has returned to more normal temperatures, more than 1 million residents are still under orders to boil water before drinking it.</p>
<p>“The president has made very clear to us that in crises like this, it is our duty to organize prompt and competent federal support to American citizens, and we have to ensure that bureaucracy and politics do not stand in the way,” said Homeland Security Adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall, who accompanied Biden to Houston.</p>
<p>Biden was joined for much of his visit by Gov. Greg Abbott and Sen. John Cornyn, both Republicans, four Democratic Houston-area members of Congress and Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner and Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo.</p>
<p>The president also stopped by a mass coronavirus vaccination center at NRG Stadium that is run by the federal government. Biden on Thursday commemorated the 50 millionth COVID-19 vaccination since he took office, halfway toward his goal of 100 million shots by his 100th day in office. That celebration followed a moment of silence to mark the passage earlier this week of 500,000 U.S. deaths blamed on the disease.</p>
<p>Democrat Biden suggested that he and Republicans Abbott and Cornyn could find common cause in getting Americans vaccinated as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>“We disagree on plenty of things,” Biden said. “There’s nothing wrong with that, but there are plenty of things we can work on together. And one of them is represented right here today, the effort to speed up vaccinations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Texas&#8217; other U.S. senator, Ted Cruz, an ally of former President Donald Trump and one of a handful of GOP lawmakers who had objected to Congress certifying Biden’s victory, was in Florida Friday addressing the Conservative Political Action Conference.</p>
<p>Cruz, who has been criticized for taking his family to Cancun, Mexico, while millions of Texans shivered in unheated homes, later said the trip was a mistake, but he made light of the controversy on Friday. “Orlando is awesome,” he said to laughs and hoots. “It’s not as nice as Cancun. But’s nice.”</p>
<p>At the peak of the storm, more than 1.4 million residents were without power and 3.5 million were under boil-water notices in Houston&#8217;s Harris County, the nation&#8217;s third largest county.</p>
<p>Post-storm debate in Texas has centered on the state maintaining its own electrical grid and its lack of better storm preparation, including weatherization of key infrastructure. Some state officials initially blamed the blackouts on renewable energy even though Texas relies heavily on oil and gas.</p>
<p>In Washington, Biden&#8217;s climate adviser said the deadly winter storm was a “wake-up call” for the United States to build energy systems that can withstand extreme weather linked to climate change.</p>
<p>“We need systems of energy that are reliable and resilient,” Gina McCarthy said in an interview with The Associated Press.</p>
<p>The White House said Biden&#8217;s purpose in visiting was to support, not scold.</p>
<p>Biden was bent on asking Texans &#8220;what do you need, how can I help you more,&#8221; White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. “And what can we get more for you from the federal government.”</p>
<p>Biden has declared a major disaster in Texas and asked federal agencies to identify additional resources to aid the recovery. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has sent emergency generators, bottled water, ready-to-eat meals and blankets.</p>
<p>Galveston County Judge Mark Henry said in an interview that he didn&#8217;t know what more the federal government could do to help because the failures were at the state level. But Henry, a Republican who is the highest county official in the suburban Houston county, said that if Biden “thinks it&#8217;s important to visit, then come on down.”</p>
<p>Biden wanted to make the trip last week, but said at the time that he held back because he didn’t want his presence and entourage to detract from the recovery effort.</p>
<p>Houston also was the destination for Trump&#8217;s first presidential visit to a disaster area in 2017 after Hurricane Harvey caused catastrophic flooding that August.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate parliamentarian dealt a potentially lethal blow Thursday to Democrats’ drive to hike the minimum wage, deciding that the cherished progressive goal must fall from a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill the party is trying to speed through Congress, Senate Democratic aides said.</p>
<p>The finding by Elizabeth MacDonough, the chamber’s nonpartisan arbiter of its rules, means Democrats face an overwhelmingly uphill battle to boost the minimum wage this year because of solid Republican opposition. Their proposal would raise the federal minimum gradually to $15 hourly by 2025, well above the $7.25 floor in place since 2009.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden was “disappointed” in the outcome but respected the parliamentarian&#8217;s ruling, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. The Senate has a long tradition of obeying the parliamentarian&#8217;s decisions with few exceptions, a history that is revered by traditionalists like Biden, a 36-year Senate veteran.</p>
<p>“He will work with leaders in Congress to determine the best path forward because no one in this country should work full time and live in poverty,” Psaki said.</p>
<p>Democrats are pushing the massive coronavirus relief measure through Congress under special rules that will let them avoid a Senate filibuster by Republicans, a tactic that Democrats would need an unattainable 60 votes to defeat.</p>
<p>But those same Senate rules prohibit provisions with only an “incidental” impact on the federal budget because they are chiefly driven by other policy purposes. MacDonough said the minimum wage provision didn&#8217;t pass that test, according to aides who described her decision on condition of anonymity because it hadn&#8217;t been released.</p>
<p>MacDonough&#8217;s decision forces Democrats to make politically painful choices about what to do next on the minimum wage, which has long caused internal party rifts.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Democrats “are not going to give up the fight” to raise the minimum wage to $15.</p>
<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, hailed MacDonough&#8217;s decision. He said it shows the special procedure that Democrats are using to protect the relief bill “cannot be used as a vehicle to pass major legislative change — by either party — on a simple majority vote.&#8221;</p>
<p>Republicans solidly oppose the $15 minimum wage target as an expense that would hurt businesses and cost jobs. They also oppose the overall relief bill, saying it’s too expensive, not targeted enough at the people and businesses that most need it and a grab bag of gifts for Democratic allies.</p>
<p>In the wake of the decision, Democratic leaders were likely to face unrest from rank-and-file lawmakers, who have long had differences over the federal minimum wage. They can afford little dissension: Democrats have just a 10-vote edge in the House and no votes to spare in the 50-50 Senate.</p>
<p>Progressives seeking to maximize Democratic control of the White House and Congress have wanted party leaders to push aggressively on the issue. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., who leads the near 100-member Congressional Progressive Caucus, said Senate Democrats should include the wage increase in the relief bill anyway and not be stopped by “the advisory opinion of the parliamentarian and Republican obstructionism.”</p>
<p>But Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona have voiced opposition to including the minimum wage hike in the relief bill, and other moderates have expressed concerns, too.</p>
<p>Even so, MacDonough&#8217;s decision might actually make passage of the overall relief bill easier because efforts to find a minimum wage compromise among Democrats could have been contentious.</p>
<p>Democrats have said they could still pursue a minimum wage boost in free-standing legislation or attach it to legislation expected later this year that is to be aimed at a massive infrastructure program. But they’d still face the challenge of garnering 60 Senate votes, a hurdle that has upended Democratic attempts to boost the minimum wage for over a decade.</p>
<p>Senate Budget Committee Chair Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a chief sponsor of the minimum wage effort, blamed “archaic and undemocratic&#8221; Senate rules for the setback. He said he&#8217;d try amending the overall relief package to erase tax deductions from large corporations that don’t pay workers at least $15 an hour and to provide incentives to small businesses to raise wages.</p>
<p>The parliamentarian&#8217;s decision came to light the night before Democrats were set to push through the House an initial version of the $1.9 trillion relief legislation that still includes the minimum wage boost.</p>
<p>“House Democrats believe that the minimum wage hike is necessary. Therefore, this provision will remain in the&#8221; bill, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said.</p>
<p>The overall relief bill is Biden’s first legislative priority. It is aimed at combating a year-old pandemic that’s stalled much of the economy, killed half a million Americans and reshaped the daily lives of virtually everyone.</p>
<p>Despite their paper-thin congressional majorities, Democratic leaders were hoping that House approval of the package would be followed by passage in the Senate, where changes seem likely. Democrats are aiming to get the legislation to Biden’s desk by mid-March.</p>
<p>The relief bill would provide millions of people with $1,400 direct payments. It contains billions of dollars for vaccines and COVID-19 testing, schools, state and local governments, the ailing restaurant and airline industries and emergency jobless benefits while providing tax breaks to lower earners and families with children.</p>
<p>In a study that’s been cited by both sides in the clash, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the $15 minimum wage would increase pay for 27 million workers and lift 900,000 people out of poverty by 2025, but also kill 1.4 million jobs.</p>
<p>Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia have state minimum wages that exceed the federal $7.25 hourly floor, with only the District of Columbia currently requiring a $15 minimum.</p>
<p>Seven states have laws putting their minimums on a pathway to $15 in a future year, according to the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Democratic-led House passed a bill Thursday that would enshrine LGBTQ protections in the nation&#8217;s labor and civil rights laws, a top priority of President Joe Biden, though the legislation faces an uphill battle in the Senate.</p>
<p>The bill passed by a vote of 224-206 with three Republicans joining Democrats in voting yes.</p>
<p>The Equality Act amends existing civil rights law to explicitly include sexual orientation and gender identification as protected characteristics. The protections would extend to employment, housing, loan applications, education, public accommodations and other areas. Supporters say the law before the House on Thursday is long overdue and would ensure that every person is treated equally under the law.</p>
<p>“The LGBT community has waited long enough,&#8221; said Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who is gay and the bill&#8217;s lead sponsor. “The time has come to extend the blessings of liberty and equality to all of Americans regardless of who they are and who they love.&#8221;</p>
<p>Republicans broadly opposed the legislation. They echoed concerns from religious groups and social conservatives who worry the bill would force people to take actions that contradict their religious beliefs. They warned that faith-based adoption agencies seeking to place children with a married mother and father could be forced to close, or that private schools would have to hire staff whose conduct violates tenets of the school&#8217;s faith.</p>
<p>“This is unprecedented. It&#8217;s dangerous. It&#8217;s an attack on our first freedom, the first freedom listed in the Bill of Rights, religious liberty,&#8221; said Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La.</p>
<p>The House <a href="https://apnews.com/article/a64dc269b2864b89aad3e0d110f4f536">passed</a> the Equality Act in the last Congress with unanimous Democratic support and the backing of eight Republicans, but Donald Trump&#8217;s White House opposed the measure and it was not considered in the Senate, where 60 votes will be needed to overcome procedural hurdles. Democrats are trying to revive it now that they have control of Congress and the White House, but passage still appears unlikely in the evenly divided Senate.</p>
<p>This time, Republican Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and John Katko and Tom Reed of New York sided with Democrats in voting for the bill.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court provided the LGBTQ community with a resounding victory last year in a 6-3 ruling that said the Civil Rights Act of 1964 applied to LGBTQ workers when it comes to barring discrimination on the basis of sex. Civil rights groups have encouraged Congress to follow up that decision and ensure that anti-bias protections addressing such areas as housing, public accommodations and public services are applied in all 50 states.</p>
<p>Biden made clear his support for the Equality Act in the lead-up to last year&#8217;s election, saying it would be <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ab96c4d9b3a84ef9b10598781ff38e93">one of his first</a> priorities.</p>
<p>Democratic Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Penn., said the Equality Act is needed to end “the patchwork of state laws” around gay rights and create “uniform nationwide protection.”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s been personal since my baby sister came out to me almost 40 years ago,&#8221; Scanlon said. “For many people all across this country and across this House, that is when the fight hits home.&#8221;</p>
<p>The debate among lawmakers on Capitol Hill also become personal. Rep. Marie Newman, D-Ill., whose daughter is transgender, tweeted a video of herself placing a transgender flag outside her office. Her office is across the hall from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who was recently blocked from serving on two committees because of past comments and tweets.</p>
<p>“Our neighbor, @RepMTG, tried to block the Equality Act because she believes prohibiting discrimination against trans Americans is “disgusting, immoral, and evil.” Thought we’d put up our Transgender flag so she can look at it every time she opens her door.,&#8221; Newman tweeted.</p>
<p>Greene responded with a video of her own in which she puts up a sign that reads: “There are Two genders: MALE and FEMALE. “Trust The Science!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Our neighbor, @RepMarieNewman, wants to pass the so-called “Equality” Act to destroy women’s rights and religious freedoms. Thought we’d put up ours so she can look at it every time she opens her door,&#8221; Greene tweeted.</p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., pointed to the exchange to advocate for the bill Thursday.</p>
<p>“It breaks my heart that it is necessary, but the fact is, and in fact we had a sad event here even this morning, demonstrating the need for us to have respect,&#8221; Pelosi said, at one point pausing and taking a deep sigh. “Not even just respect, but take pride, take pride in our LGBT community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gay and lesbian members of Congress spoke about how meaningful the bill is for them.</p>
<p>“Look, we&#8217;re not asking for anything that any other American doesn&#8217;t already enjoy,&#8221; said Rep. Chris Pappas, D-N.H. “We just want to be treated the same. We just want politicians in Washington to catch up with the times and the Constitution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leaders at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops wrote lawmakers this week to say they had grave concerns about the bill. Among the concerns they raised is that the bill would expand the government&#8217;s definition of public places, forcing church halls and equivalent facilities to host functions that violate their beliefs, which could lead to closing their doors to the broader community.</p>
<p>Republicans cited an array of consequences they said could occur if the bill passed into law, from eliminating the existing ban on the use of government funds for abortion, to allowing transgender people into women&#8217;s shelters and transgender youth into girls sports. Democrats likened the effort to past civil rights battles in the nation&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>Cicilline challenged Republicans, “I hope you will bear in mind how your vote will be remembered years from now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the nation&#8217;s largest corporations are part of a coalition in support of the legislation, including Apple Inc., AT&amp;T, Chevron and 3M Co., just to name a few of the hundreds of companies that have endorsed it.</p>
<p>After the vote advocacy groups weighed in, with the Human Rights Campaign describing the vote as “bringing us closer to ensuring that every person is treated equally under the law.&#8221; Meanwhile, the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom called on the Senate to “reject this dangerous bill — for the good of all Americans.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Capitol Police knew armed extremists were primed for violence at the iconic building on Jan. 6 and even provided officers with assault rifles to protect lawmakers, the acting chief acknowledged Wednesday. But the wild invasion of the Capitol was far worse than police expected, leaving them unprepared to fight it off.</p>
<p>A day earlier, her predecessor as chief testified that police expected an enraged but more typical protest crowd of Donald Trump supporters. But Acting Chief Yogananda Pittman said intelligence collected ahead of the riot prompted the agency to take extraordinary measures, including the special arming of officers, intercepting radio frequencies used by the invaders and deploying spies at the Ellipse rally where President Donald Trump was sending his supporters marching to the Capitol to “fight like hell.”</p>
<p>Pittman&#8217;s testimony, submitted ahead of a House hearing on Thursday, provides the most detailed account yet of the intelligence and preparations by U.S. Capitol Police ahead of the insurrection when thousands of pro-Trump rioters invaded the Capitol aiming to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden&#8217;s election victory over Trump.</p>
<p>Three days earlier, On Jan. 3, Capitol Police distributed an internal intelligence assessment warning that militia members, white supremacists and other extremist groups were likely to participate, that demonstrators would be armed and that it was possible they would come to the Capitol to try to disrupt the vote, Pittman says.</p>
<p>“Based on the assessment, the Department understood that this demonstration would be unlike the previous demonstrations held by protesters with similar ideologies in November and December 2020,” Pittman says in her prepared remarks.</p>
<p>But at the same time, she argues police didn’t have enough intelligence to predict the violent insurrection that resulted in five deaths, including that of a Capitol Police officer. They prepared for trouble but not an invasion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although the Department’s January 3rd Special Assessment foretold of a significant likelihood for violence on Capitol grounds by extremists groups, it did not identify a specific credible threat indicating that thousands of American citizens would descend upon the U.S. Capitol attacking police officers with the goal of breaking into the U.S. Capitol Building to harm Members and prevent the certification of Electoral College votes,” Pittman says in her testimony.</p>
<p>Steven Sund, the police force’s former chief who resigned after the riot, testified Tuesday that the intelligence assessment warned white supremacists, members of the far-right Proud Boys and leftist antifa were expected to be in the crowd and might become violent.</p>
<p>“We had planned for the possibility of violence, the possibility of some people being armed, not the possibility of a coordinated military style attack involving thousands against the Capitol,” Sund said.</p>
<p>The FBI also forwarded a warning to local law enforcement officials about online postings that a “war” was coming. But Pittman said it still wasn’t enough to prepare for the mob that attacked the Capitol.</p>
<p>Officers were vastly outnumbered as thousands of rioters descended on the building, some of them wielding planks of wood, stun guns, bear spray and metal pipes as they broke through windows and doors and stormed through the Capitol. Officers were hit with barricades, shoved to the ground, trapped between doors, beaten and bloodied as members of Congress were evacuated and congressional staffers cowered in offices.</p>
<p>Should police have been better prepared?</p>
<p>With the amount of information available to the Capitol Police, it’s surprising that they didn’t take additional steps to reinforce security and protect their officers, said Tom Warrick, a former counterterrorism official who served in the Obama administration.</p>
<p>“On Jan. 6, the one strategic location in the entire U.S. national capital region that had to be defended was the U.S. Capitol,” said Warrick, now with the Atlantic Council. “So it was really disappointing you have people testifying that ‘we didn’t know there would be violence.’ When you are the target, you assume that things like that can happen even if you don’t have the intel.”</p>
<p>Even without access to secure intelligence, there were months of warning signs in public view that rioters would try to do what they did, said Bruce Hoffman, a former commissioner on the 9/11 Review Commission and a senior fellow for counterterrorism and homeland security for the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
<p>A plot uncovered by federal law enforcement to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was a major red flag, and many of the rioters went on social media to echo Trump’s calls to “stop the steal” and speculate about violence.</p>
<p>“Historically, the default is always to blame it on an intelligence failure when often there may well be other reasons,” Hoffman said. “I think it was very obvious to anyone &#8230;. that a confrontation was going to occur.”</p>
<p>Pittman also says the department faced “internal challenges” as it responded to the riot. Officers didn’t properly lock down the Capitol complex, even after an order had been given over the radio to do so. She also says officers didn’t understand when they were allowed to use deadly force, and that less-than-lethal weapons that officers had were not as successful as they expected.</p>
<p>While Pittman says in her testimony that that sergeants and lieutenants were supposed to pass on intelligence to the department’s rank and file, many officers have said they were given little or no information or training for what they would face. Four officers told The Associated Press shortly after the riot that they heard nothing from Sund, Pittman, or other top commanders as the building was breached. Officers were left in many cases to improvise or try to save colleagues facing peril.</p>
<p>Pittman also faces internal pressure from her rank and file, particularly after the Capitol Police union issued a vote of no confidence against her last week. She must also lead the department through the start of several investigations into how law enforcement failed to protect the building.</p>
<p>Capitol Police are investigating the actions of 35 police officers on the day of the riot; six of those officers have been suspended with pay, a police spokesman said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(CNN) &#8212; Republican leaders in both chambers are maneuvering to keep all of their members in line against the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief plan, a move that would deny President Joe Biden a bipartisan victory and one that could scuttle the bill in the Senate if any Democrat breaks ranks.</p>
<p>But the move amounts to a political risk for Republicans with polls showing clear majorities of Americans supporting an emergency rescue package and with the economy still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>So Republicans now plan to begin an urgent public relations push to argue that the bill is bloated, poorly targeted and contains a hodgepodge of measures aimed at pleasing the Democratic base &#8212; a message that party leaders discussed with their members at a private GOP lunch on Tuesday and that they plan to echo in the days ahead, attendees say. And Republicans hope that after months of bitter party infighting, they can now finally unite and take their battle toward Democrats &#8212; and not each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the Democrats continue down the path they&#8217;re on, and that is to not make any attempt to try and get Republican input or ideas, it makes it hard for any of our members, even those that might be inclined to do so to vote for it, to vote for anything,&#8221; said Senate Minority Whip John Thune told CNN. &#8220;So, if it&#8217;s in its current contours, it&#8217;s hard to see very many, if any, Republicans being for it, especially given the way the Democrats have approached it.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the lunch on Tuesday, GOP senators talked at length about the Democrats&#8217; bill, with attendees criticizing it in sharp terms. They discussed their strategy for putting Democrats in a difficult political spot when amendment votes happen next week in the Senate, while also putting forward some middle-of-the-road amendments that could attract some Democratic support, according to attendees.</p>
<p>And afterward, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell blasted the Democrats&#8217; plan as &#8220;totally partisan,&#8221; while acknowledging that his party had work to do on its messaging in the face of public support for the Biden plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure everybody would love to get a check,&#8221; McConnell said, referring to the checks of up to $1,400 for certain individuals in the proposal. &#8220;But they haven&#8217;t yet learned about what else is in it and part of our job as the substantial minority, remember we&#8217;re in a 50-50 Senate here, is to make sure the American people fully understand what&#8217;s being proposed.&#8217;</p>
<p>Democrats, however, argue that they have a mandate after winning the White House and the Senate and are taking urgently needed action to deliver aid to an American public suffering under the devastating toll of the ongoing pandemic. They have insisted they are willing to work with Republicans but will not water down the plan &#8212; a lesson they say they learned from then-President Barack Obama&#8217;s first stimulus plan in 2009.</p>
<p>&#8220;Democrats remain committed to working with our colleagues from the other side of the aisle &#8230; to improve the bill,&#8221; Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday. &#8220;But at the end of the day, the American people sent us here with a job to do, and the clock is ticking. Democrats will not wait to move forward with the American rescue plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bill &#8212; which includes a federal minimum wage hike to $15 per hour, staggering sums for schools, states and cities, along with an extension of jobless benefits and money for vaccine distribution and nutrition assistance &#8212; heads to the House floor by week&#8217;s end where Speaker Nancy Pelosi has little margin for error since Republicans are expected to unify against it. The House is going to vote on the bill Friday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said on Twitter.</p>
<p>Hoyer told CNN on Tuesday night, &#8220;I don&#8217;t anticipate that,&#8221; when asked if he expected to lose any Democratic support in his chamber.</p>
<p>And while House GOP leaders are confident their members will fall in line, some are still mum about their plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t decided yet,&#8221; Rep. John Katko, a New York Republican, said when asked if he would vote for the $1.9 trillion bill.</p>
<p>GOP leaders believe that the moment is similar to 2009, when a new Democratic President pushed through a major relief plan with scant GOP backing &#8212; more than a year before their party took back control of Congress, a message that former Vice President Mike Pence privately delivered to a group of conservative lawmakers on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Indeed, Republicans believe that public opinion will shift on the matter &#8212; eventually.</p>
<p>Asked if it will hurt Republicans to oppose a politically popular bill, Thune said: &#8220;Once we get the message out there about what it includes, how much it is, what the potential impacts are on the economy, minimum wage being a good example then I think we&#8217;ll see more. I think that&#8217;ll change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thune added that the GOP will focus on how the money in the proposal would be spent on schools. &#8220;I think the school reopening issue is a really hot issue &#8211; particularly in suburbia,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>If the House passes the bill, which is expected, it then heads to the Senate next week where the rules will prevent Republicans from employing a filibuster to block it, since Democrats are using a fast-track budget process known as reconciliation to advance the plan by just 51 votes. Yet Schumer has no margin for error in the 50-50 Senate, since any single Democratic defection could bring down the centerpiece of the Biden agenda &#8212; and at least two moderate Democratic senators have voiced concerns about the wage hike in the plan.</p>
<p>So far, the potential GOP swing votes have lambasted Democrats to argue they&#8217;ve been shut out of the talks &#8212; and have shown no willingness to vote for the proposal.</p>
<p>&#8220;There has been very little effort on the part of the White House to meet with us and to see if we can find a middle ground, a common ground of some kind,&#8221; Sen. Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, said on Tuesday. &#8220;I think the leadership in the House and the Senate just wants to blast ahead with reconciliation without any input from Republicans at all, and that&#8217;s not the way good legislation is crafted. Good legislation has both sides working on things, knocking off the edges, finding a better and better bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, several GOP swing votes, such as Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Romney, have been irked at the White House&#8217;s handling of the proposal &#8212; and are signaling they are all but certain to vote against the plan. And in the House, Republican leaders are whipping their colleagues to fall in line &#8212; with GOP sources predicting that they won&#8217;t lose any votes on the floor when the bill is considered by the full chamber at the end of the week.</p>
<p>Collins said on Tuesday the Biden administration won&#8217;t budge from its topline price tag for the package. &#8220;I would be surprised if there were support in the Republican caucus if the bill comes out at 1.9 trillion even if we&#8217;re able to make some beneficial changes.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Collins faulted both Schumer and White House chief of staff Ron Klain, whom she signaled out after a group of 10 GOP senators met with Biden on the matter earlier this month.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem is that the what appears to be productive talks, seem to be countermanded by the Democratic leader in the Senate,&#8221; Collins said. After praising Biden for being &#8220;very attentive&#8221; and &#8220;gracious&#8221; at their recent meeting, Collins said: &#8220;Ron was shaking his head in the back of the room the whole time, which is not exactly an encouraging sign. I thought that was unfortunate.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden plans to distribute millions of face masks to Americans in communities hard-hit by the coronavirus, as part of his efforts to ensure “equity” in the government&#8217;s response to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Biden, who like Donald Trump’s administration considered sending masks to all Americans, is instead adopting a more conservative approach, aiming to reach underserved communities and those bearing the brunt of the outbreak. Trump&#8217;s administration shelved the plans entirely.</p>
<p>Biden&#8217;s plan will distribute masks not through the mail, but instead through Federally Qualified Community Health Centers and the nation&#8217;s food bank and food pantry systems, the White House announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, and Agriculture will be involved in the distribution of more than 25 million American-made cloth masks in both adult and kid sizes. The White House estimates they will reach 12 million to 15 million people.</p>
<p>“Not all Americans are wearing masks regularly, not all have access, and not all masks are equal,” said White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients.</p>
<p>Biden hinted at the move Tuesday during a virtual roundtable discussion Tuesday with four essential workers who are Black, saying he expected his administration to send millions of masks to people around the country “very shortly.”</p>
<p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki suggested earlier this month that logistical concerns underpinned the decision to scale back the plans to send masks to all Americans.</p>
<p>“I think there are some underlying questions about how you target them — the masks — where they go to first; obviously, it couldn’t happen immediately,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Biden has asked everyone to wear face masks for the first 100 days of his term. He also required mask-wearing in federal buildings and on public transportation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Missed intelligence was to blame for the outmanned Capitol defenders&#8217; failure to anticipate the violent mob that invaded the iconic building and halted certification of the presidential election on Jan. 6, the officials who were in charge of security that day said Tuesday in their first public testimony on the insurrection.</p>
<p>The officials, including the former chief of the Capitol Police, pointed their fingers at various federal agencies — and each other — for their failure to defend the building as supporters of then-President Donald Trump overwhelmed security barriers, broke windows and doors and sent lawmakers fleeing from the House and Senate chambers. Five people died as a result of the riot, including a Capitol Police officer and a woman who was shot as she tried to enter the House chamber with lawmakers still inside.</p>
<p>Former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who resigned under pressure immediately after the attack, and the other officials said they had expected the protests to be similar to two pro-Trump events in late 2020 that were far less violent. Sund said he hadn’t seen an FBI field office report that warned of potential violence citing online posts about a “war.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sund described a scene as the mob arrived at the perimeter that was “like nothing” he had seen in his 30 years of policing and argued that the insurrection was not the result of poor planning by Capitol Police but of failures across the board.</p>
<p>“No single civilian law enforcement agency – and certainly not the USCP – is trained and equipped to repel, without significant military or other law enforcement assistance, an insurrection of thousands of armed, violent, and coordinated individuals focused on breaching a building at all costs,” he testified.</p>
<p>The hearing was the first of many examinations of what happened that day, coming almost seven weeks after the attack and over a week after the Senate voted to acquit Trump of inciting the insurrection by telling his supporters to “fight like hell” to overturn his election defeat. Fencing and National Guard troops still surround the Capitol in a wide perimeter, cutting off streets and sidewalks that are normally full of cars, pedestrians and tourists.</p>
<p>The joint hearing, part of an investigation by two Senate committees, was the first time the officials testified publicly about the events of Jan. 6. In addition to Sund, former Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger, former House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving and Robert Contee, the acting chief of police for the Metropolitan Police Department, testified.</p>
<p>Irving and Stenger also resigned under pressure immediately after the deadly attack. They were Sund’s supervisors and in charge of security for the House and Senate.</p>
<p>“We must have the facts, and the answers are in this room,&#8221; Senate Rules Committee Chairwoman Amy Klobuchar said at the beginning of the hearing. The Rules panel is conducting the joint probe with the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>Even after the hearing, much still remains unknown about what happened before and during the assault. How much did law enforcement agencies know about plans for violence that day, many of which were public? And how could the Capitol Police have been so ill-prepared for a violent insurrection that was organized online?</p>
<p>Sund told the lawmakers that he didn&#8217;t know then that his officers had received a report from the FBI’s field office in Norfolk, Virginia, that forecast, in detail, the chances that extremists could bring “war” to Washington the following day. The head of the FBI’s office in Washington has said that once he received the Jan. 5 warning, the information was quickly shared with other law enforcement agencies through a joint terrorism task force.</p>
<p>Sund said Tuesday that an officer on the task force had received that memo and forwarded it to a sergeant working on intelligence for the Capitol Police but that the information was not sent on to other supervisors.</p>
<p>“How could you not get that vital intelligence?” asked Senate Homeland Chairman Gary Peters, D-Mich., who said the failure of the report to reach the chief was clearly a major problem.</p>
<p>“That information would have been helpful,” Sund acknowledged.</p>
<p>Even without the intelligence, there were clear signs that violence was a possibility on Jan. 6. Far-right social media users openly hinted for weeks that chaos would erupt at the U.S. Capitol while Congress convened to certify the election results.</p>
<p>Sund said he did see an intelligence report created within his own department warning that Congress could be targeted on Jan. 6. But he said that report assessed the probability of civil disobedience or arrests, based on the information they had, as “remote” to “improbable” for the groups expected to demonstrate.</p>
<p>Contee, the acting city police chief, also suggested that no one had flagged the FBI information from Norfolk, Virginia, which he said came in the form of an email. He said he would have expected that kind of intelligence “would warrant a phone call or something. ”</p>
<p>Sund and Irving disagreed on when the National Guard was called and on requests for the guard beforehand. Sund said he spoke to both Stenger and Irving about requesting the National Guard in the days before the riot, and that Irving said he was concerned about the “optics” of having them present. Irving denied that, saying Sund&#8217;s account was “categorically false.&#8221;</p>
<p>“We all agreed the intelligence did not support the troops and collectively decided to let it go,” Stenger said.</p>
<p>After smashing through the barriers at the perimeter, the invaders engaged in hand-to-hand combat with police officers, injuring dozens of them, and broke into the building.</p>
<p>Once the violence had begun, Sund and Irving also disagreed on when the National Guard was requested — Sund said he requested it at 1:09 p.m., but Irving denied receiving a call at that time.</p>
<p>Contee said he was “stunned” over the delayed response. He said Sund was pleading with Army officials to deploy National Guard troops as the rioting rapidly escalated. Police officers “were out there literally fighting for their lives” but the officials appeared to be going through a ”check the boxes” exercise, he said.</p>
<p>Pentagon officials, who will be invited to testify before the committee at a second hearing next week, have said it took time to put the troops in position, and there was not enough contingency planning in advance. They said they offered the assistance beforehand but were turned down.</p>
<p>Klobuchar said after the hearing that the next police chief should have greater ability to make decisions both leading up to and during a crisis, and the Rules panel could consider such legislation once the investigation is completed. The current structure “clearly needs some reform,” she said.</p>
<p>The hearing Tuesday was the first of several this week examining what went wrong Jan. 6. A House subcommittee will examine damage to the Capitol on Wednesday and will hear testimony from currrent security officials, including Acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman, on Thursday. Next week, the Senate panels will invite officials from the Pentagon, FBI and Homeland Security Department.</p>
<p>In prepared testimony released ahead of the hearing on damage to the Capitol, Architect of the Capitol J. Brett Blanton and the curator of the House of Representatives, Farar Elliott, describe damage to statues and paintings and quick thinking by staff as the rioting was underway — including one aide who secured the House’s 1819 silver inkstand, the oldest object in the chamber.</p>
<p>Congress is also considering a bipartisan, independent commission, and multiple congressional committees have said they will look at different aspects of the siege. Federal law enforcement has arrested more than 230 people who were accused of being involved in the attack, and Attorney General nominee Merrick Garland said in his confirmation hearing Monday that investigating the riot would be a priority.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden will visit Texas on Friday as the state begins its recovery from a devastating winter storm that caused serious damage to homes and businesses across the state and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/houston-football-storms-coronavirus-pandemic-hurricanes-5fd491ed5bfd9aa0ae08426c6078539e">left many without power</a> or clean water for days.</p>
<p>The White House announced Tuesday that Biden and his wife, Jill, will travel to Houston on Friday. While there, he&#8217;ll meet with local leaders to discuss the ongoing recovery from last week&#8217;s winter storm, and will visit a COVID-19 health center where vaccines are being distributed.</p>
<p>Millions of Texas residents remain under boil water notices after the freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall caused power outages and burst pipes across the state, prompting local officials to warn Texans about the safety of their tap water. Some Texans have been left cleaning up extensive damage done by heavy snowfall and burst pipes in their homes and businesses, while others have been saddled with thousands of dollars in electricity bills after power grid failures affected production and demand.</p>
<p>Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said Sunday on CBS&#8217; “Face the Nation” the state of Texas should bear those “exorbitant costs,&#8221; rather than residents.</p>
<p>“For people getting these exorbitant electricity bills and having to pay to repair their homes, they should not have to bear the responsibility,” he said.</p>
<p>The White House announced on Saturday that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-oklahoma-storms-coronavirus-pandemic-weather-be1cd891f05fb20e4d77f6f5e734c935">the president had declared a major disaster</a> in Texas, and he has asked federal agencies to identify additional resources to address the suffering.</p>
<p>Biden previously tweeted about Texas and the other affected states, received regular updates from his staff and declared states of emergency in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. Biden spoke to the governors of the seven states most affected by the winter weather. He tweeted a photo of himself on the phone with Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas.</p>
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency also shipped dozens of generators and supplies, including fuel, water, blankets and ready-to-eat meals, to the affected areas.</p>
<p>Biden said last week that he hoped to travel to Texas but he didn&#8217;t want his presence and the accompanying presidential entourage to distract from the recovery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) —</p>
<p>With sunset remarks and a national moment of silence, President Joe Biden on Monday confronted head-on the country&#8217;s once-unimaginable loss — half a million Americans in the COVID-19 pandemic — as he tried to strike a balance between mourning and hope.</p>
<p>Addressing the “grim, heartbreaking milestone” directly and publicly, Biden stepped to a lectern in the White House Cross Hall, unhooked his face mask and delivered an emotion-filled eulogy for more than 500,000 Americans he said he felt he knew.</p>
<p>“We often hear people described as ordinary Americans. There&#8217;s no such thing,&#8221; he said Monday evening. “There&#8217;s nothing ordinary about them. The people we lost were extraordinary.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Just like that,” he added, &#8220;so many of them took their last breath alone.”</p>
<p>A president whose own life has been marked by family tragedy, Biden spoke in deeply personal terms, referencing his own losses as he tried to comfort the huge number of Americans whose lives have been forever changed by the pandemic.</p>
<p>“I know all too well. I know what it’s like to not be there when it happens,&#8221; said Biden, who has long addressed grief more powerfully than perhaps any other American public figure. &#8220;I know what it’s like when you are there, holding their hands, as they look in your eye and they slip away. That black hole in your chest, you feel like you’re being sucked into it.”</p>
<p>The president, who lost his first wife and baby daughter in a car collision and later an adult son to brain cancer, leavened the grief with a message of hope.</p>
<p>&#8220;This nation will smile again. This nation will know sunny days again. This nation will know joy again. And as we do, we’ll remember each person we’ve lost, the lives they lived, the loved ones they left behind.”</p>
<p>He said, “We have to resist becoming numb to the sorrow. We have to resist viewing each life as a statistic or a blur or, on the news. We must do so to honor the dead. But, equally important, to care for the living.”</p>
<p>The president ordered flags on federal property lowered to half staff for five days and then led the moment of communal mourning for those lost to a virus that often prevents people from gathering to remember their loved ones. Monday&#8217;s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-deaths-nears-500k-coronavirus-acab3cc916330a3f068b7589350a18cd">bleak threshold of 500,000 deaths was playing out</a> against contradictory crosscurrents: an encouraging drop in coronavirus cases and worries about the spread of more contagious variants.</p>
<p>Biden&#8217;s management of the pandemic will surely define at least the first year of his presidency, and his response has showcased the inherent tension between preparing the nation for dark weeks ahead while also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-new-york-new-york-city-bill-de-blasio-nashville-4ffa86c709f6a843de9cf0711e7215cf">offering optimism about pushing out vaccines </a>that could, eventually, bring this American tragedy to a close.</p>
<p>After he spoke, the president along with first lady Jill Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff stood outside the White House for a moment of silence at sundown. Black bunting draped the doorway they walked through. Five hundred brilliantly lit candles — each standing for 1,000 people lost — illuminated the stairways on either side of them as the Marine Band played a mournful rendition of “Amazing Grace.&#8221;</p>
<p>The milestone comes just over a year after the first confirmed U.S. fatality from the coronavirus. The pandemic has since swept across the world and the U.S., stressing the nation&#8217;s health care system, rattling its economy and rewriting the rules of everyday society.</p>
<p>In one of his many symbolic breaks with his predecessor, Biden has not shied away from offering remembrances for the lives lost to the virus. His first stop after arriving in Washington on the eve of his inauguration was to attend a twilight ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool to mourn the dead.</p>
<p>That somber moment on the eve of Biden’s inauguration — typically a celebratory time when America marks the democratic tradition of a peaceful transfer of power — was a measure of the enormity of loss for the nation.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 death total in the United States had just crossed 400,000 when Biden took the oath of office. An additional 100,000 have died in the past month.</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump invariably looked to play down the total, initially claiming the virus would go away on its own and later locking into a prediction that America would suffer far fewer than 100,000 deaths. Once the total eclipsed that mark, Trump shifted gears again and said that scale of loss was actually a success story because it could have been much worse.</p>
<p>Outside of perfunctory tweets marking the milestones of 100,000 and 200,000 deaths, Trump oversaw no moment of national mourning, no memorial service. At the Republican National Convention, he made no mention of the suffering, leaving that to first lady Melania Trump.</p>
<p>And at campaign rallies across the nation, he erroneously predicted that the nation was “rounding the corner” on the virus while he disregarded safety measures such as masks and pushed governors to lift restrictions against public health advice. In audio tapes released last fall, it was revealed that Trump told journalist Bob Woodward in March that “I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down because I don’t want to create a panic.”</p>
<p>Biden, by contrast, has long drawn on his own personal tragedy as he comforts those who grieve. He has pledged to level with the American public on the severity of the crisis and has repeatedly warned that the nation was going through a “very dark winter,” one now challenged by the arrival of more contagious virus variants.</p>
<p>Biden also has deliberately set expectations low — particularly on vaccinations and when the nation can return to normal — knowing he could land a political win by exceeding them. He is on track to far exceed his initial promise to deliver 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days, with some public health experts now urging him to set a far more ambitious goal. The administration says it expects to have enough vaccine available for every American by the end of July.</p>
<p>Biden&#8217;s reference to next Christmas for a possible return to normalcy raised eyebrows across a pandemic-weary nation and seemed less optimistic than projections made by others in his own administration, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has suggested a summer comeback.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump will be making his first post-presidential appearance at a conservative gathering in Florida next weekend.</p>
<p>Ian Walters, spokesman for the American Conservative Union, confirmed that Trump will be speaking at the group&#8217;s annual Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 28.</p>
<p>Trump is expected to use the speech to talk about the future of the Republican Party and the conservative moment, as well as to criticize President Joe Biden’s efforts to undo his immigration policies, according to a person who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the plans.</p>
<p>CPAC is being held this year in Orlando, Florida, and will feature a slew of former Trump administration officials and others who represent his wing of the GOP, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem.</p>
<p>Trump has been keeping a relatively low profile since he retired from the White House to Palm Beach, Florida, in January, but reemerged last week to conduct a series of phone-in interviews to commemorate the death of conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh.</p>
<p>Trump has a long history with CPAC, which played a key role in his emergence as a political force.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(CNN) &#8212; The Biden administration is rolling back the controversial Trump-era naturalization civics test, reverting to a prior version of the exam, according to a <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/policy-manual-updates/20210222-CivicsTest.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policy alert </a>published Monday.</p>
<p>US Citizenship and Immigration Services, which administers the test, announced it will go back to using a 2008 version. The agency had received thousands of comments on the Trump administration&#8217;s exam, as well as President Joe Biden&#8217;s executive order on restoring faith in the legal immigration system.</p>
<p>In December, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/10/politics/trump-citizenship-naturalization-exam/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implemented its revised civics test</a>, which made changes to test content, increased the number of questions for applicants to study, and updated the number of questions applicants had to answer correctly.</p>
<p>At the time, immigration experts warned it could slow down the process and discourage people from seeking citizenship and legal immigration benefits.</p>
<p>The Trump-era test may &#8220;inadvertently&#8221; create potential barriers to the naturalization process, the Biden administration determined.</p>
<p>USCIS declined to elaborate on why the administration believes the 2020 test needs to be tossed out. News that the Biden administration was planning to ditch the Trump-era exam was <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hamedaleaziz/biden-us-citizenship-test-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first reported</a> by BuzzFeed News.</p>
<p>Over the course of his presidency, Donald Trump tried to curtail legal immigration and doubled down on citizenship, teasing an end to birthright citizenship and attempting to include a citizenship question on the census.</p>
<p>The naturalization exam is a crucial step to an immigrant&#8217;s path toward US citizenship, potentially impacting hundreds of thousands of immigrants who seek citizenship annually.</p>
<p>Multiple comments on the Trump-era test noted that there was little advance notice before its implementation, raising concerns about limited time for study and preparation of training materials and resources, according to the USCIS policy alert.</p>
<p>The update goes into effect on March 1 and there will be a brief period during which the agency may offer both versions of the test to accommodate applicants who were already studying for the Trump-era version.</p>
<p>USCIS, a part of the Department of Homeland Security, was at the center of several of the Trump administration&#8217;s hardline immigration policies, including ones that made it exceedingly difficult for migrants to seek asylum in the US and the controversial &#8220;public charge&#8221; rule, which makes it harder for immigrants to obtain legal status if they use public benefits.</p>
<p>Ken Cuccinelli, a former top DHS official in the Trump administration, brought the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/10/politics/cucinelli-uscis-acting-director/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agency into a rare spotlight</a> when he served as acting USCIS director, working to rebrand it as an vetting agency rather than a benefits one.</p>
<p>Cuccinelli touted the efforts by the Trump administration to revise the test.</p>
<p>&#8220;Updating, maintaining, and improving a test that is current and relevant is our responsibility as an agency in order to help potential new citizens fully understand the meaning of U.S. citizenship and the values that unite all Americans,&#8221; <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/news/news-releases/uscis-announces-plan-to-improve-the-naturalization-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cuccinelli said in a statement </a>when the agency announced it would revise the naturalization exam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Faulty intelligence was to blame for the outmanned Capitol defenders&#8217; failure to anticipate the violent mob that invaded the iconic building and halted certification of the presidential election on Jan. 6, the officials who were in charge of security declared Tuesday in their first public testimony on the insurrection.</p>
<p>The officials, including the former chief of the Capitol Police, pointed their fingers at various federal agencies — and each other — for their failure to defend the building as supporters of then-President Donald Trump overwhelmed security barriers, broke windows and doors and sent lawmakers fleeing from the House and Senate chambers. Five people died as a result of the riot, including a Capitol Police officer and a woman who was shot as she tried to enter the House chamber with lawmakers still inside.</p>
<p>Former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who resigned under pressure after the attack, and the other officials said they had expected the protests to be similar to two pro-Trump events in late 2020 that were far less violent.</p>
<p>He said he hadn’t seen an FBI field office report that warned of potential violence citing online posts about a “war.” And he and a House official disputed each other&#8217;s versions of decisions that January day and in advance about calling for the National Guard.</p>
<p>Sund described a scene as the mob arrived at the perimeter that was “like nothing” he had seen in his 30 years of policing and argued that the insurrection was not the result of poor planning by Capitol Police but of failures across the board.</p>
<p>The hearing was the first of many examinations of what happened that day, coming almost seven weeks after the attack and over a week after the Senate voted to acquit Trump of inciting the insurrection by telling his supporters to “fight like hell” to overturn his election defeat. Fencing and National Guard troops still surround the Capitol in a wide perimeter, cutting off streets and sidewalks that are normally full of cars, pedestrians and tourists.</p>
<p>Sund insisted the invasion was not his or his agency&#8217;s fault.</p>
<p>“No single civilian law enforcement agency – and certainly not the USCP – is trained and equipped to repel, without significant military or other law enforcement assistance, an insurrection of thousands of armed, violent, and coordinated individuals focused on breaching a building at all costs,” he testified.</p>
<p>The joint hearing, part of an investigation by two Senate committees, was the first time the officials testified publicly about the events of Jan. 6. In addition to Sund, former Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger, former House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving and Robert Contee, the acting chief of police for the Metropolitan Police Department, testified.</p>
<p>Like Sund, Irving and Stenger resigned under pressure after the deadly attack. They were Sund’s supervisors and in charge of security for the House and Senate.</p>
<p>“We must have the facts, and the answers are in this room,&#8221; Senate Rules Committee Chairwoman Amy Klobuchar said at the beginning of the hearing. The Rules panel is conducting the joint probe with the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>Much remains unknown about what happened before and during the assault. How much did law enforcement agencies know about plans for violence that day, many of which were public? How did the agencies share that information with each other? And how could the Capitol Police have been so ill-prepared for a violent insurrection that was organized online?</p>
<p>Sund told the lawmakers that he learned only after the attack that his officers had received a report from the FBI’s field office in Norfolk, Virginia, that forecast, in detail, the chances that extremists could bring “war” to Washington the following day. The head of the FBI’s office in Washington has said that once he received the Jan. 5 warning, the information was quickly shared with other law enforcement agencies through a joint terrorism task force.</p>
<p>Sund said Tuesday that an officer on the task force had received that memo and forwarded it to a sergeant working on intelligence for the Capitol Police but that the information was not sent on to other supervisors.</p>
<p>“How could you not get that vital intelligence?” asked Senate Homeland Chairman Gary Peters, D-Mich., who said the failure of the report to reach the chief was clearly a major problem.</p>
<p>“That information would have been helpful,” Sund acknowledged.</p>
<p>Even without the intelligence, there were clear signs that violence was a possibility on Jan. 6. Far-right social media users openly hinted for weeks that chaos would erupt at the U.S. Capitol while Congress convened to certify the election results.</p>
<p>Sund said he did see an intelligence report created within his own department warning that Congress could be targeted on Jan. 6. But he said that report assessed the probability of civil disobedience or arrests, based on the information they had, as “remote” to “improbable” for the groups expected to demonstrate.</p>
<p>Contee, the acting city police chief, also suggested that no one had flagged the FBI information from Norfolk, Virginia, which he said came in the form of an email. He said he would have expected that kind of intelligence “would warrant a phone call or something. ”</p>
<p>Two officials disagreed on when the National Guard was called and on requests for the guard beforehand. Sund said he spoke to both Stenger and Irving about requesting the National Guard in the days before the riot, and that Irving said he was concerned about the “optics” of having them present.</p>
<p>Irving denied that, saying Sund&#8217;s account was “categorically false.” Safety, not optics, determined the security posture, he said, and the top question was whether intelligence supported the decision.</p>
<p>“We all agreed the intelligence did not support the troops and collectively decided to let it go,” Stenger said. He added that they were satisfied at the time that there was a &#8220;robust&#8221; plan to protect Congress.</p>
<p>After smashing through the barriers at the perimeter, the invaders engaged in hand-to-hand combat with police officers, injuring dozens of them, and broke into the building.</p>
<p>Once the violence had begun, Sund and Irving also disagreed on when the National Guard was requested — Sund said he requested it at 1:09 p.m., but Irving said he didn’t receive a request until after 2 p.m., right as rioters breached the Capitol&#8217;s West side.</p>
<p>Contee said he was “stunned” over the delayed response. He said Sund was pleading with Army officials to deploy National Guard troops as the rioting rapidly escalated. Police officers “were out there literally fighting for their lives” but the officials on the call appeared to be going through a ”check the boxes” exercise, he said.</p>
<p>Pentagon officials, who will have a chance to testify before the committee at a second hearing next week, have said it took time to put the troops in position, and there was not enough contingency planning in advance. They said they offered the assistance beforehand but were turned down.</p>
<p>Klobuchar said after the hearing that the next police chief should have greater ability to make decisions both leading up to and during a crisis, and the Rules panel could consider such legislation once the investigation is completed. The current structure “clearly needs some reform,” she said.</p>
<p>Congress is also considering a bipartisan, independent commission, and multiple congressional committees have said they will look at different aspects of the siege. Federal law enforcement has arrested more than 230 people who were accused of being involved in the attack, and President Joe Biden&#8217;s nominee for attorney general, Judge Merrick Garland, said in his confirmation hearing Monday that investigating the riot would be a priority.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — In life, the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh was a divisive figure, who proudly waved the flag of conservatism and wallowed in the controversies he helped ignite. In death, those controversies follow him as partisans in his home state of Florida debate over whether to lower the state flag in his honor.</p>
<p>Gov. Ron DeSantis called Limbaugh a “legend” and ordered flags to be flown at half-staff as a show of respect after the longtime broadcaster died Wednesday of cancer.</p>
<p>But Democrats, who have long been on the receiving end of Limbaugh&#8217;s harangues, objected.</p>
<p>Nikki Fried, Florida&#8217;s Agriculture Commissioner and the only statewide Democratic officeholder and who is considering a bid for governor, said Monday that she would not abide by the Republican governor&#8217;s orders.</p>
<p>“Lowering to half-staff the flag of the United States of America is a sacred honor that pays respect to fallen heroes and patriots,” she said in a statement, in which she said she would notify all state officer under her purview to disregard the governor&#8217;s order.</p>
<p>Fried oversees about two dozen agricultural law enforcement inspection stations, 38 state forests and nine regional licensing offices.</p>
<p>“We will not celebrate hate speech, bigotry, and division,” she said. &#8220;Lowering the flag should always reflect unity, not division, and raising our standards, not lowering them. Our flags will remain flying high to celebrate the American values of diversity, inclusion, and respect for all.”</p>
<p>DeSantis said Limbaugh&#8217;s stature justified the honor.</p>
<p>“When there’s things of this magnitude, once the date of interment for Rush is announced, we’re going to be lowering the flags to half-staff,” DeSantis said at a Friday news conference in Palm Beach County.</p>
<p>A year ago, President Donald Trump awarded Limbaugh the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, during his final State of the Union address.</p>
<p>The day before, Limbaugh had announced that he was battling advanced lung cancer.</p>
<p>Limbaugh had for decades championed conservativism — often stridently at the expense of liberals and Democrats.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Merrick Garland, President Joe Biden&#8217;s attorney general nominee, vowed Monday to prioritize combating extremist violence and said his first focus would be on the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol as he sought to assure lawmakers that the Justice Department would remain politically independent on his watch.</p>
<p>A federal appeals court judge who was snubbed by Republicans for a seat on the Supreme Court in 2016, Garland appeared Monday before the Senate Judiciary Committee and is widely expected to sail through his confirmation process with bipartisan support.</p>
<p>“The attorney general represents the public interest, particularly and specifically as defined by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States,” Garland said. “I do not plan to be interfered with by anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Garland will inherit a Justice Department that endured a tumultuous era under Trump — rife with political drama and controversial decisions — and that faced abundant criticism from Democrats over what they saw as the politicizing of the nation’s top law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>“I have grown pretty immune to any kind of pressure, other than the pressure to do what I think is the right thing, given the facts and the law. That is what I intend to do as the attorney general, I don’t care who pressures me in whatever direction,” he said.</p>
<p>Early in the hearing, Garland faced questioning about his plans to handle specific investigations and politically sensitive cases, like the federal tax investigation involving Biden’s son Hunter Biden, and the special counsel’s inquiry started by William Barr, while he was attorney general, into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation, which also remains open.</p>
<p>Garland said he had not spoken with Biden about the investigation into his son. He said he had agreed to the nomination as attorney general because the president had vowed that “decisions about investigations and prosecutions will be left to the Justice Department.”</p>
<p>Garland, though saying he was supportive of transparency and in publicly explaining Justice Department decision-making, declined to commit to making public the results of the Durham investigation. He said under questioning from Sen. Chuck Grassley, the committee’s top Republican, that he had not spoken to Durham yet but had no reason to think that former Attorney General William Barr’s decision to give Durham special counsel status to remain in his position was “not the correct decision.”</p>
<p>To date, Durham has interviewed officials from the FBI, Justice Department and the CIA regarding the early days of the Russia investigation, and has produced criminal charges against just one person — a former FBI lawyer who pleaded guilty to altering an email. Garland said “there were certainly serious problems” with applications for surveillance during the FBI’s Russia investigation, and that he intended as attorney general to speak more deeply about the issue with the Justice Department’s inspector general and with the FBI director.</p>
<p>“I am always concerned and have always been concerned that we be very careful about FISA,” Garland said, using the acronym for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.</p>
<p>Garland’s failed nomination to the Supreme Court wasn’t far from lawmakers minds’, with the bitter partisan feelings over the 2016 confirmation battle apparent in the hearing room. Sen. Chuck Grassley, who was chairman of the panel at the time and carried out GOP leader Mitch McConnell’s directive to block Garland from the court, defended his role, saying he took a position and “stuck to it.” He then criticized Democrats over their handling of Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation.</p>
<p>Still, he indicated he would be supportive of Garland.</p>
<p>“I admire Judge Garland’s public service,” Grassley said. “Just because I disagreed with anyone being nominated didn’t mean that I had to be disagreeable to that nominee.”</p>
<p>Garland said his first briefing as attorney general would be focused on the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 and promised to provide prosecutors with whatever resources they need to bring charges in the cases.</p>
<p>“I will supervise the prosecution of white supremacists and others who stormed the Capitol on January 6 — a heinous attack that sought to disrupt a cornerstone of our democracy: the peaceful transfer of power to a newly elected government,” Garland said in his opening statement.</p>
<p>Biden’s choice of Garland reflects the president’s goal of restoring the department’s reputation as an independent body. During his four years as president, Donald Trump insisted that the attorney general must be loyal to him personally, a position that battered the department’s reputation.</p>
<p>In his prepared remarks, Garland focused on prioritizing policing and civil rights to combat racial discrimination — he says America doesn’t “yet have equal justice” — as well as confronting the rise in extremist violence and domestic terror threats and restoring the department’s political independence after years of controversial decisions and turmoil.</p>
<p>“Communities of color and other minorities still face discrimination in housing, education, employment, and the criminal justice system; and bear the brunt of the harm caused by pandemic, pollution, and climate change,” Garland said.</p>
<p>As civil rights groups and activists push Biden, a death penalty foe, to take immediate action to halt federal executions after an unprecedented run of capital punishment during the Trump administration, Garland described his reservation about the death penalty and its impact.</p>
<p>He said he believes it is likely the Biden administration could issue a moratorium on the death penalty after 13 federal executions were carried out in the final six months of the Trump administration. They were the first federal executions in nearly 20 years and became super-spreader events during the coronavirus pandemic. Garland said the death penalty gives him “great pause” and is concerned about what he sees as the “almost randomness or arbitrariness of its application” and the “disparate impact” the death penalty has on Black Americans.</p>
<p>Garland is an experienced judge who held senior positions at the Justice Department decades ago, including as a supervisor in the prosecution of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which led to the execution of Timothy McVeigh. But he is set to return to a department that is radically different from the one he left. His experience prosecuting domestic terrorism cases could prove exceptionally handy.</p>
<p>Garland held back tears as Sen. Cory Booker asked Garland about his family&#8217;s history confronting hate and discrimination.</p>
<p>“I come from a family where my grandparents fled antisemitism and persecution. The country took us in, and protected us, and I feel an obligation to the country to pay back, and this is the highest best use of my own set of skills to pay back,&#8221; Garland said. &#8220;So I very much want to be the kind of attorney general that you’re saying I could become, and I’ll do my best to become that kind of attorney general.”</p>
<p>His nomination has gained public support on both sides of the political aisle, from more than 150 former Justice Department officials — including former attorneys general Loretta Lynch, Michael Mukasey and Alberto Gonzales, along with 61 former federal judges. Others, including two sons of former Attorney General Edward Levi, have also written letters of support to Congress.</p>
<p>“There have been few moments in history where the role of attorney general — and the occupant of that post — have mattered more,” the committee’s chairman, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON (AP) — With sunset remarks and a national moment of silence, President Joe Biden is planning a head-on acknowledgment of the country&#8217;s once-unimaginable loss...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — With sunset remarks and a national moment of silence, President Joe Biden is planning a head-on acknowledgment of the country&#8217;s once-unimaginable loss — half a million Americans in the COVID-19 pandemic —. in striking contrast to the approach of his predecessor.</p>
<p>Confronting the grim milestone directly and publicly, Biden is trying to strike a balance between gravity and hope, while Donald Trump generally avoided constructs of collective grief for the deaths on his watch.</p>
<p>Monday&#8217;s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-deaths-nears-500k-coronavirus-acab3cc916330a3f068b7589350a18cd">bleak threshold was playing out</a> against contradictory crosscurrents: an encouraging drop in coronavirus cases and worries about the spread of more contagious variants.</p>
<p>A president whose own life has been marked by family tragedy, Biden ordered flags on federal property lowered to half staff for five days as he prepared to lead a moment of communal mourning for those lost to a virus that often prevents people from gathering to remember their loved ones.</p>
<p>Biden&#8217;s management of the pandemic will surely define at least the first year of his presidency, and his response has showcased the inherent tension between preparing the nation for dark weeks ahead while also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-new-york-new-york-city-bill-de-blasio-nashville-4ffa86c709f6a843de9cf0711e7215cf">offering optimism about pushing out vaccines </a>that could, eventually, bring the pandemic to a close.</p>
<p>“I believe we’ll be approaching normalcy by the end of this year. And God willing, this Christmas will be different than the last,” Biden said Friday while touring a Pfizer vaccine manufacturing plant in Michigan.</p>
<p>“But I can’t make that commitment to you,&#8221; he was quick to add. &#8220;There are other strains of the virus. We don’t know what could happen in terms of production rates. Things can change,” Biden continued. “But we’re doing everything the science has indicated we should do, and people are stepping up to get everything done that has to be done.”</p>
<p>Biden, first lady Jill Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff were to lead a national moment of silence at sundown from the White House. They were to light a candle to mark the half-million deaths. White House press secretary Jen Psaki called the ceremony “a human moment.”</p>
<p>“The president felt it was important to mark the lives lost over the past year and that’s the purpose of tonight,” Psaki said during an afternoon press briefing. “Tonight is not the night to give advice to the public or give an update on progress being made.”</p>
<p>The milestone comes just over a year after the first confirmed U.S. fatality from the coronavirus. The pandemic has since swept across the world and the U.S., stressing the nation&#8217;s health care system, rattling its economy and rewriting the rules of everyday society.</p>
<p>In one of his many symbolic breaks with Trump, Biden has not shied away from offering remembrances for the lives lost to the virus. His first stop after arriving in Washington on the eve of his inauguration was to attend a twilight ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool to mourn the dead.</p>
<p>“For many months we have grieved by ourselves,” Harris said then. “Tonight, we grieve and begin healing together.”</p>
<p>That somber moment on the eve of Biden’s inauguration — typically a celebratory time when America marks the democratic tradition of a peaceful transfer of power — was a measure of the enormity of loss for the nation.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 death total in the United States had just crossed 400,000 when Biden took the oath of office. An additional 100,000 have died in the past month.</p>
<p>Trump invariably looked to play down the total, initially claiming the virus would go away on its own and later locking into a prediction that America would suffer far fewer than 100,000 deaths. Once the total eclipsed that mark, Trump shifted gears again and said that scale of loss was actually a success story because it could have been much worse.</p>
<p>Outside of perfunctory tweets marking the milestones of 100,000 and 200,000 deaths, Trump oversaw no moment of national mourning, no memorial service. At the Republican National Convention, he made no mention of the suffering, leaving that to first lady Melania Trump.</p>
<p>And at campaign rallies across the nation, he erroneously predicted that the nation was “rounding the corner” on the virus while he disregarded safety measures such as masks and pushed governors to lift restrictions against public health advice. In audio tapes released last fall, it was revealed that Trump told journalist Bob Woodward in March that “I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down because I don’t want to create a panic.”</p>
<p>Biden, by contrast, has long drawn on personal tragedy — his first wife and two of their children have preceded him in death — as he comforts those who grieve. He has pledged to level with the American public on the severity of the crisis and has repeatedly warned that the nation was going through a “very dark winter,” one now challenged by the arrival of more contagious virus variants.</p>
<p>Biden also has deliberately set expectations low — particularly on vaccinations and when the nation can return to normal — knowing he could land a political win by exceeding them. He is on track to far exceed his initial promise to deliver 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days, with some public health experts now urging him to set a far more ambitious goal. The administration says it expects to have enough vaccine available for every American by the end of July.</p>
<p>Biden&#8217;s reference to next Christmas for a possible return to normalcy raised eyebrows across a pandemic-weary nation and seemed less optimistic than projections made by others in his own administration, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has suggested a summer comeback.</p>
