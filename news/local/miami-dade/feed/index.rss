										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good Samaritans raced to help a woman and an elderly man minutes after, police said, they were <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-dade/search-underway-for-19-year-old-after-shooting-in-sw-miami-dade-leaves-1-dead-2-injured/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shot inside of a Southwest Miami-Dade home</a> during a domestic dispute that left a man dead and led to the arrest of a 19-year-old suspect.</p>
<p>Ring doorbell video captured area resident Lisa Pelaez and her husband rendering aid to a 74-year-old man moments after he fled the home, in the area of Southwest 142nd Avenue and 294th Street, Saturday morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s shooting up the house,&#8221; the man is heard saying in the video.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s still there?&#8221; asked Pelaez.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah!&#8221; said the man.</p>
<p>According to Miami-Dade Police, Ruben Warren Williams ran away after shooting three of his family members. His cousin, identified as 27-year-old Carlton Tillman, was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
<p>Detectives said four children were in the home when the shots rang out.</p>
<p>“According to investigators, there was a verbal dispute inside of the residence that escalated and led to shots fired,” said MDPD detective Khristopher Welch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were so scared,&#8221; said Pelaez.</p>
<p>Investigators said Williams&#8217; grandfather had asked him not to smoke marijuana in the house, and that led to an argument.</p>
<p>Police said Williams became angry and opened fire, striking Tillman, his grandfather and his aunt.</p>
<p>Detectives said the suspect&#8217;s aunt and grandfather jumped from a second-floor window. The grandfather broke both his ankles, and even still, both he and the suspect&#8217;s aunt ran for help.</p>
<p>Pelaez, who lives two doors down, said the older victim headed to her home.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aunt, who jumped out of the second-story building, went this way, and the grandfather went this way to my house,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I opened the door immediately. He said, &#8216;I&#8217;ve been shot. My grandson shot me; he&#8217;s shooting everybody.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Pelaez said she immediately called 911 and tried to treat his wounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;My husband ran and grabbed a towel from our closet, he put the towel on his back, on the gunshot wound,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I ran in the house, and I grabbed a chair, and we sat him down on the chair. The grandfather said, &#8216;My legs broke, my legs broke,&#8217; and I&#8217;m asking the grandfather, &#8216;Where&#8217;s the lady, where&#8217;s the lady?'&#8221;</p>
<p>Surveillance video captured Williams&#8217; aunt as she limped to a nearby home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I picked her up, and I put her to the side of the house to try and hide her body,&#8221; said a resident at this home. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know where the guy was at the time. In that short instant, the paramedics came, so they were able to take over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police said <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-dade/19-year-old-arrested-charged-with-murder-in-shooting-that-left-man-dead-2-others-injured/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Williams was arrested Saturday</a> after he hopped into a woman&#8217;s car and forced her to drive for hours at gunpoint.</p>
<p>Investigators said the suspect also shot and killed a neighbor&#8217;s dog during the rampage.</p>
<p>Neighbors said they&#8217;re thankful for Williams&#8217; quick capture.</p>
<p>&#8220;My friends and my family and I are so relieved, you do not understand,&#8221; said Pelaez.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, that&#8217;s good. Hopefully the lady survives,&#8221; said the resident who helped Williams&#8217; aunt.</p>
<p>Williams is facing multiple charges, including second-degree murder, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, child abuse and animal cruelty with intent to injure or kill.</p>
<p>As of Sunday night, police have not identified the surviving victims, who remain at Jackson South Medical Center. Their conditions are currently unknown.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring breakers spotted without face masks at two popular South Florida destinations have raised concerns that the gatherings could lead to an increase in coronavirus cases.</p>
<p>This weekend brought <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/local-leaders-urge-spring-breakers-to-social-distance-wear-masks-as-crowds-grow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more large crowds</a> to Fort Lauderdale Beach. 7News cameras captured many revelers not wearing masks or following COVID protocols.</p>
<p>More maskless beachgoers were spotted Sunday in Miami Beach.</p>
<p>That city&#8217;s leaders are hoping to keep things calm by <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-beach-fort-lauderdale-implement-rules-and-safety-guidelines-as-spring-break-begins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closing beaches</a> at 7 p.m. and ordering businesses along the beach to shut down by midnight.</p>
<p>Anyone with questions and concerns about the coronavirus can call the Florida Department of Health&#8217;s 24-hour hotline at 1-866-779-6121.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police have arrested a 19-year-old man in connection to a <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-dade/search-underway-for-19-year-old-after-shooting-in-sw-miami-dade-leaves-1-dead-2-injured/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shooting at a Southwest Miami-Dade home</a> that left a man dead and sent a woman and an elderly man to the hospital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FLORIDA CITY, Fla. (AP/WSVN) &#8212; A South Florida vaccination site had so few eligible takers Saturday that it started inoculating any adult who wanted a shot rather than let the vaccine on hand go to waste.</p>
<p>Word spread, and on Sunday, the Florida City site was overwhelmed, particularly after local state Sen. Annette Taddeo incorrectly tweeted that the federally run site would again take all comers. The Democrat, who was the party&#8217;s lieutenant governor candidate in 2014, later deleted that tweet and corrected herself.</p>
<p>Frustration and confusion set in among the hundreds of people who came to the site run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>
<p>Among those were Kathy Benezra.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite upset. They changed the rules in the morning,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Police had to calm the crowd when the site again enforced the state&#8217;s eligibility rules: 65 and older; frontline medical workers and police officers, teachers and firefighters over 50; and younger people with a physician&#8217;s note saying they would be endangered if they caught the virus.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article249760473.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Miami Herald</a>, a Florida City police officer through a megaphone told 200 people waiting in line, “If you do not meet the criteria, you will not be vaccinated today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people went away once they heard the criteria, but [the line] was all the way around the block,&#8221; said Benezra.</p>
<p>Benezra said she got there at around 7 a.m. because she heard the site was giving vaccinations to anyone over the age of 18 who wanted one.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been here, and now the rules have changed,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The confusion appeared to stem from what happened on Saturday.</p>
<p>Vaccines must be refrigerated at extremely cold temperatures and used that day once they are removed. Rather than letting doses go to waste, workers on Saturday reportedly began giving them out to any adult regardless of profession or medical history.</p>
<p>That is not unusual &#8211; many drugstores, for example, will inject anyone in the store at closing time if they have leftover vaccines that would spoil otherwise.</p>
<p>Word of what reportedly happened at the Florida City site quickly spread online, and people came from miles to the small town on the Florida peninsula&#8217;s southern tip to get their shots.</p>
<p>The FEMA-run site administers 500 doses per day.</p>
<p>Mike Jachles with the Florida Association of Public Information Officers issued a statement that reads in part, &#8220;The FEMA-supported sites are adhering to the governor&#8217;s most recent executive order.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many who met the eligibility requirements received their vaccine doses at the larger FEMA-run site at Miami-Dade College&#8217;s North Campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very easy, and I&#8217;m very happy to live in this country,&#8221; said patient Magda Caceres..</p>
<p>&#8220;Super quick, super easy,&#8221; said patient Viviane Carneiro.</p>
<p>Schoolteachers and school employees of all ages are also eligible at FEMA-supported sites.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once the governor opened it up to teachers, I&#8217;m like, &#8216;I&#8217;m out here as soon as I can,'&#8221; said Angel Beswick.</p>
<p>For her, the MDC site was the happiest place on Earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels like I&#8217;m at Disney World, honestly. I&#8217;m so excited,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>As the race to vaccinate continues, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava urged the governor to <a href="https://twitter.com/MayorDaniella/status/1368636288170139648?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expand eligibility requirements</a>.</p>
<p>Sunday night, state officials reported 3,878 vaccinations at the three FEMA-run sites in South Florida. Of these inoculations, 3,160 took place at the MDC North Campus site, 321 at the Florida City site and 397 at the site located in Sweetwater.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The owner of a freight forwarding business in Doral is reeling hours after thieves were caught on surveillance video driving away with a 23-foot boat in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Nelson Gonzalez of MVP International Freight Systems spoke with 7News on Saturday about the overnight theft of a 23-foot Robalo.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was actually shipping to our customer in Aruba,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a big deal to a big customer, and not only that; in these trying times, freight forwarding has suffered a lot. This affects us a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gonzalez said he left the family-owned business at around midnight on Friday, and not long after, someone started scoping it out.</p>
<p>About an hour and a half later, Gonzalez said, the crooks made their move.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thank God we had cameras, and we have cameras from different angles in every single part of this warehouse, so we were able to take pictures and post them out,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The surveillance video captured a pickup truck backing up. Someone is seen getting out and hitching the boat onto the truck.</p>
<p>Three minutes later, the thieves drove off with the boat in tow.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw that it&#8217;s a Ford F-150 extended cab &#8212; it&#8217;s a workman&#8217;s truck &#8212; and it had a spotter,&#8221; said Gonzalez, &#8220;so a spotter was actually spotting with them, and he was driving a Ford Focus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Gonzalez is hoping someone is able to get the vessel back where it belongs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all trying to feed our families. We&#8217;re all trying to keep our employees afloat, so any business, anything that we get, we have to make the best out of it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and this is not just a hard blow to us. This also [affects] our customers who live on the islands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gonzalez said his customer in Aruba is now out about $12,000.</p>
<p>If you have any information on this theft, call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS. Remember, you can always remain anonymous, and you may be eligible for a $1,000 reward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A food truck that was <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-dade/ne-miami-dade-couples-food-truck-stolen-from-outside-apartment-complex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stolen in front of its owners</a> outside the couple&#8217;s Northeast Miami-Dade apartment building has been found.</p>
<p>The victims, Chef Bryan Rivas and Andrea Larrotta, said the trailer was recovered in Allapattah, Friday night, hours after it was stolen.</p>
<p>The couple said they use the truck to make a living, and it&#8217;s gotten them through the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The truck will need some work. The name of the couple&#8217;s business had been painted over in black when it was recovered.</p>
<p>Larrotta said that&#8217;s not all they&#8217;re worried about now.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mixed emotions because it feels great, and at the same, it doesn&#8217;t feel so good because of how they kind ofvandalized it a little bit,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They painted over our wrap, so we couldn&#8217;t see our logo. Inside, it&#8217;s a disaster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Surveillance cameras captured the thief getting away with the heavy haul from the couple&#8217;s apartment building.</p>
<p>It was found with the help of a GPS tracker.</p>
<p>Police have not made any arrests.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police are searching for a 19-year-old man in connection to a shooting in a Southwest Miami-Dade home that left a man dead and sent a woman and an elderly man to the hospital.</p>
<p>Miami-Dade Police and Fire Rescue units responded to the scene of the incident in the area of Southwest 142nd Avenue and 294th Street, just after 11:15 a.m., Saturday.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to investigators, there was a verbal dispute inside of the residence that escalated and led to shots fired,&#8221; said MDPD detective Khristopher Welch.</p>
<p>Michael Baker told 7News he is the suspect&#8217;s uncle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate what my nephew did, and I want to punish him, but you have to let the Lord work in His way,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Area resident Sarah Smith said she heard gunfire.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard gunshots. I heard like five to six,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Baker described the incident as an escalation of a family dispute.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is shock, because we have a good family, and this is the first time this here has happened in our family, period,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Detectives said the suspect, who they have identified as Ruben Warren Williams, then took off. First responders later found the three victims.</p>
<p>&#8220;An adult male was pronounced deceased on scene by Miami-Dade Fire Rescue. The other adult male and adult female were transported by Miami-Dade Fire Rescue to an area hospital in critical condition,&#8221; said Welch.</p>
<p>Detectives have identified the adult male as 27-year-old Carlton Tillman.</p>
<p>Investigators spent the afternoon and evening working the case, while neighbors said they are now on edge.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really scary to think that, like, it&#8217;s so close to home, and it&#8217;s just like, can I even be safe in my own home? It&#8217;s really hard,&#8221; said Smith.</p>
<p>If you have any information on this shooting or Williams&#8217; whereabouts, call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS. Remember, you can always remain anonymous, and you may be eligible for a $3,000 reward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 3,000 people came to the federal COVID-19 vaccination site at Miami Dade College&#8217;s North Campus, but despite the large crowds, patients described a smooth relatively short process.</p>
<p>It was busy and bustling Saturday morning at the <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/new-mass-vaccination-site-at-mdc-north-opens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive FEMA-run site</a>, located in Northwest Miami-Dade.</p>
<p>Among those who lined up for their dose was 83-year-old Henry Sturrup.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m certainly glad I came here this morning,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was the best thing that could have happened to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others said they waited hours just for a parking spot, but once they had one, the crew made the process of actually receiving a shot quick and easy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great job, amazing people. They&#8217;re heroes; I love it,&#8221; said patient Roberto Carneiro.</p>
<p>Rainy weather rolled in Saturday afternoon, but it didn&#8217;t stop some from coming out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am grateful for the opportunity to be protected,&#8221; said Mercedes Medina, a professor at Miami Dade College.</p>
<p>Medina said she is at a higher risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19 because she has diabetes.​</p>
<p>She said she been teaching virtually, and after being fully vaccinated, she hopes to see her students in person soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something about that live engagement that I miss,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I love the remote teaching that gives flexibility, but it shouldn&#8217;t be in place of live teaching.&#8221;</p>
<p>At one point, the downpour caused a pause in operations at the site, but crews were able to reopen once the rain abated.</p>
<p>With the rain likely playing a part, some patients said their wait was much shorter than those who showed up earlier.</p>
<p>Medina said she waited in the car line for just 10 minutes, and the vaccination process took about 30.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were very organized,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The FEMA-run site is open seven days a week from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.</p>
<p>All Florida residents 65 and older can get a vaccine, as well as police officers and firefighters 50 and older.</p>
<p>Anyone over the age of 18 who is a teacher, school employee or has underlying health conditions is also allowed to receive the vaccine.</p>
<p>Patients who have one those of medical conditions need to bring a doctor&#8217;s note or <a href="http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/covid-physician-form/EO-21-47-Form.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this form</a> signed by a doctor.</p>
<p>When adding the totals from sites in Sweetwater and Florida City to those at the MDC location, state officials said, 4,093 people were vaccinated on Saturday. Of these inoculations, 3,093 took place at the MDC site, 2,344 with the Pfizer vaccine and 749 with the single-shot Johnson&amp; Johnson vaccine.</p>

<p>Hialeah Police confirmed they took Joel Luis Polanco into custody on Saturday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Zoo Miami celebrated a major milestone for three &#8220;otter-ly&#8221; adorable pups, just in time for the weekend.</p>
<p>The North American river otters, two male and one female, turned 1 month old on Friday.</p>
<p>The pups received their first neonatal exam earlier this week. Zoo officials said they &#8220;appear to be thriving&#8221; and are being well cared for by their first-time mom.</p>
<p>The otters are currently secluded with their mother in an off-exhibit area until they open their eyes and are able to swim.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bicyclist Michael Hernandez is thankful to be alive after becoming the victim of a hit-and-run in Miami&#8217;s Brickell neighborhood.</p>
<p>&#8220;He clipped me probably doing 50, 60 miles an hour,&#8221; Hernandez said.</p>
<p>City of Miami Police said the collision happened near Brickell Avenue and 14th Street, Friday morning.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an area where Hernandez and his friends meet every day to ride their bikes, but he said at around 6:30 a.m., his ride became dangerous.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear some screeching tires behind me, and I look back, and all I see is this car just hauling down the road,&#8221; said Hernandez.</p>
<p>The car rammed into the back of his bike leaving him hurt and parts of the bike mangled.</p>
<p>&#8220;It threw my bicycle saddle pretty much straight into my rear butt cheek and right through the rear wheel, went through me, hit a light pole and into a tree,&#8221; said Hernandez.</p>
<p>7News cameras captured an orange cone where the light pole used to be, as well as shattered glass.</p>
<p>Hernandez&#8217;s attorney, Lee Marks, said after causing all the damage, the driver fled the scene.</p>
<p>&#8220;About 35 minutes later, he returned, went into the vehicle and retrieved a knapsack and a small bag, what looked like contraband, and then looked around and took off again,&#8221; Marks said. &#8220;He tried to get into an Uber. The witnesses stopped him, and then he took off up 15th Road westbound.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At that point, we&#8217;re like, &#8216;All right, this is not really an accident anymore, it&#8217;s probably a crime scene,'&#8221; said Hernandez.</p>
<p>Hernandez was able to take a picture of who, he said, was behind the wheel of the vehicle.</p>
<p>When officers arrived on scene, they found a gun inside the car.</p>
<p>Hernandez said he&#8217;s grateful to be alive.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I played in my head every time, and I&#8217;m thankful,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I thank God I walked away from it because the possibility of, best-case scenario in my head, is shattered leg, worst-case scenario, that car could&#8217;ve killed me easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hernandez still has some minor bruising and soreness but is OK.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A South Florida chef and his girlfriend are reeling hours after, they said, they witnessed thieves driving away with their sole source of income: their food truck.</p>
<p>The overnight steal, just after midnight on Friday, has left Chef Bryan Rivas and his girlfriend, Andrea Larrotta, scrambling to find a solution.</p>
<p>&#8220;It hurts us. It hurts a lot, due to the fact that we&#8217;ve got to pay bills, especially during a pandemic, when people nowadays are hurting a lot,&#8221; said Rivas.</p>
<p>The chef said he and Larrotta were out on the balcony of their apartment, located along Northeast 202nd Street, off West Dixie Highway, in Northeast Miami-Dade, at the time of the incident.</p>
<p>Rivas said he bought the food truck, technically a trailer, at the start of the pandemic so he could make a living cooking up what he describes as exclusive cuisine.</p>
<p>&#8220;From Mediterranean cuisine, Indian cuisine, Latin cuisine and American cuisine,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That is, he said, until he stood on his balcony and watched a crime unfold.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see my truck slowly moving, and I glanced, and for a second, I just paused,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Rivas said he spotted a van towing the 16-foot trailer where he does his work.</p>
<p>Surveillance cameras at a nearby building captured a glimpse of the theft in action.</p>
<p>&#8220;Completely shocked. We didn&#8217;t think this was going to happen to us,&#8221; said Larrotta.</p>
<p>Rivas said he sometimes parks the trailer right outside his community along West Dixie Highway. This time, he was trying to prepare it for a big event in Wynwood this weekend.</p>
<p>Once they spotted the thief, the couple said they rushed to track the trailer down, but it was too late.</p>
<p>&#8220;I jumped in the car and just tried to chase the truck down, but the truck got away,&#8221; said Rivas.</p>
<p>The couple said they may have to cancel upcoming gigs until they figure out where to go from here.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to pay our house bills, our rent, water, food to survive,&#8221; said Rivas.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have a backup plan, so that&#8217;s what makes it even worse,&#8221; said Larrotta. &#8220;It&#8217;s very, very hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the couple said they&#8217;re hopeful someone can spot the trailer and call police, so they can get back to work in their mobile kitchen.</p>
<p>Larrotta said she has a message for the thief.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have any kind of remorse or any kind of conscience in you, please return the trailer back,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The couple said the trailer has a GPS unit, but it only pings once a day, so they are hoping that within the next 24 hours, they&#8217;ll have a better idea of its current location.</p>
<p>If you see the trailer or have any information on this theft, call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS. Remember, you can always remain anonymous, and you may be eligible for a $1,000 reward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Drone footage in Miami Beach caught a pod of dolphins getting a surprise visitor.</p>
<p>The dolphins were swimming near Miami Beach on Friday morning when a shark quickly caught up to them.</p>
<p>They then could be seen swimming off together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman is desperate to get her dog back after the pup was stolen at gunpoint in Northwest Miami-Dade.</p>
<p>Jennifer Spratling walks her dog early in the morning every day, but she said she never expected what happened on Friday morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;He walked up to me, pointed the gun at me and told me to give him, &#8216;the [expletive] dog,'&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Spratling told 7News it was the scariest moment of her life when she came face to face with a man pointing a gun at her chest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just standing there like panicking, I didn&#8217;t know what to do,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have my cellphone on me, no cars were coming up and down the street, so I just didn&#8217;t know what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her 4-month-old dog Bella was taken in the area of Northwest 23rd Avenue and 87th Street.</p>
<p>&#8220;At first I was a little hesitant and then he, you know, like, &#8216;I&#8217;m not playing,&#8217; then I dropped the leash, and he grabbed the dog, and he just ran off,&#8221; Spratling said.</p>
<p>Spratling said the gunman was dressed all in black. She believes her dog was a target due to her being an American Bully worth $5,000.</p>
<p>Now she says she&#8217;s hoping her dog is found and not used for constant breeding.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s like family,&#8221; said Spratling. &#8220;She&#8217;s like a child to me. I don&#8217;t have any kids. I&#8217;m just real, real sad, and I&#8217;m just wishing I wouldn&#8217;t have went walking this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you have any information on Bella&#8217;s whereabouts, call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS. Remember, you can always remain anonymous, and you may be eligible for a $1,000 reward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A dog that went missing outside of a dog day care facility in Southwest Miami-Dade has been found safe, the pet&#8217;s owner said.</p>
<p>Cellphone video captured the happy reunion between Louie and his owner, Luis Vazquez, in South Miami-Dade, Friday night.</p>
<p>Cazque said he was sitting outside when he spotted the dog crossing the street. After calling out to his pet, he was able to catch the four-legged companion.</p>
<p>It was a different story hours earlier, when 7News cameras showed Vazquez calling out his pet&#8217;s name in a grassy area.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like a piece of our family is missing,&#8221; he said as he fought back tears.</p>
<p>Vazquez said he was dropping off Louie and Laila, his two newly adopted dogs, at the day care on Wednesday when he got into a crash, and the pets took off running.</p>
<p>The pet owner said the dogs went missing in the area of Southwest 132nd Avenue and 208th Street.</p>
<p>Cellphone video captured the moment Vazquez found Laila hiding in the bushes, Thursday. The canine was scared but doing OK.</p>
<p>Vazquez received a call Friday from someone who said Louie, who also goes by Luki, was spotted in the area.</p>
<p>Pet Patrol Rescue also helped in the search efforts.</p>
<p>At around 9 p.m., Vazquez said Louie has been found, and now the entire family is back together again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said she is considering lifting the countywide curfew in early April if the positivity rate stays below a certain percentage, as new federal vaccination sites continue to increase access to the COVID-19 vaccine.<p>According to a spokesperson for the mayor, Levine Cava sent a memo to the county commissioners on Friday outlining her decision to lift the curfew by April 5 if current trends continue and the 14-day average is at or below 5.5% at that time.</p><div><embed type="oembed">https://twitter.com/MayorDaniella/status/1368016304284778503</embed></div><p>In a statement, Levine Cava wrote, &#x201C;We can&#x2019;t afford to let our guard down when we are so close to the finish line.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman has died following a shooting in Hialeah, and her family said her husband is the suspect in the murder.</p>
<p>Hialeah Police were dispatched to a residence in the area of East 40th Street and Seventh Avenue, at around 7 a.m., Friday.</p>
<p>When officers arrived, they found a 40-year-old woman&#8217;s body, who had been struck with several bullets.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen something like that happen here in this neighborhood, so it&#8217;s very sad,&#8221; said next-door neighbor Bryan Lopez.</p>
<p>Lopez said he heard gunshots but didn&#8217;t see much when he looked outside his window.</p>
<p>&#8220;All I know is that it was six shots in the morning,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Police have not released the victim&#8217;s identity, but her brother has identified her as Jozory Carida Espinosa.</p>
<p>Detectives identified the suspect as Joel Luis Polanco and said he fled in a dark gray 2018 Toyota Camry sedan.</p>
<p>Neighbors said the victim was staying with her parents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Loving family, loving, caring,&#8221; said area resident Leyda Silver. &#8220;I never saw anything. I&#8217;m totally surprised.&#8221;</p>
<p>Espinosa&#8217;s family said she had been married to Polanco for 15 years. They have two children, and the shooting stemmed over their divorce.</p>
<p>Family members said the children were inside the home at the time of the shooting.</p>
<p>Investigators surrounded the scene with crime scene tape as they canvassed the area.</p>
<p>A block from the home, Ariadna Aztarain, director of the Mission of God Academy day care, said she was concerned for her children&#8217;s safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started seeing a lot of police activity. We tried to make sure that everybody stayed in a classroom in a corner, no going out to the bathroom,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I felt bad. Some of them needed to go, but I would not let them out.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to police, Polanco is considered armed and dangerous and should not be approached. He is wanted for first-degree murder.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-876766" src="https://wsvn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/030521-hialeah-bolo.jpg?quality=60&amp;strip=color&amp;w=250" alt="" width="613" height="736" srcset="https://wsvn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/030521-hialeah-bolo.jpg 828w, https://wsvn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/030521-hialeah-bolo.jpg?resize=250,300 250w, https://wsvn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/030521-hialeah-bolo.jpg?resize=768,922 768w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" /></p>
<p>As police continue their search for Polanco, neighbors said they will pray for the Espinosa&#8217;s family.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no clue what to say, but my prayers are with the family,&#8221; said area resident Arlin Rodriguez.</p>
<p>&#8220;Praying, and hopefully everything gets solved. I hope they catch him,&#8221; said Silver.</p>
<p>Espinosa&#8217;s body has since been removed from the residence and taken away from the scene.</p>
<p>If you have any information on this fatal shooting or Polanco&#8217;s whereabouts, call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS. Remember, you can always remain anonymous, and you may be eligible for a $3,000 reward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nicklaus Children&#8217;s Hospital in Miami has announced they will provide Pfizer-BioNTech&#8217;s COVID-19 vaccine to children and young adults with medical conditions at risk for serious illness if they contract the virus.</p>
<p>Starting on Monday, vaccine appointments can be requested on the <a href="https://www.nicklauschildrens.org/about-us/coronavirus-updates/covid-19-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hospital&#8217;s website</a> for those between the ages of 16 and 21 with a doctor&#8217;s note.</p>
<p>“Nicklaus Children’s is committed to our mission of prioritizing the children and young adults of our community and beyond,&#8221; said Matthew A. Love, the President and CEO of Nicklaus Children’s Health System, the parent organization of the hospital. &#8220;While most children are only mildly affected by COVID-19, those with complex conditions may be at risk of severe illness if they contract the virus. We are honored to be able to offer the vaccine to support the care of vulnerable children in Florida.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hospital said those being treated for one or more of the following conditions identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are eligible to receive the vaccine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asthma (moderate to severe)</li>
<li>Cancer</li>
<li>Cerebrovascular disease</li>
<li>Chronic kidney disease</li>
<li>Cystic fibrosis</li>
<li>Diabetes (type 1 or 2)</li>
<li>Down syndrome</li>
<li>Heart conditions</li>
<li>Hypertension</li>
<li>Immunocompromised conditions</li>
<li>Liver disease</li>
<li>Neurologic conditions</li>
<li>Obesity</li>
<li>Pulmonary fibrosis</li>
<li>Sickle cell disease</li>
<li>Thalassemia</li>
</ul>
<p>The hospital received an additional allotment of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which allowed them to offer the shot to more people. As of Friday, the hospital has vaccinated 500 eligible patients.</p>
<p>Diego Diaz has been doing his first year at Duke University online in South Florida because the 18-year-old has Cystic fibrosis.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to be very careful when I go outside, so I mostly stay indoors, and the few times I do go outside, I still have to be more cautious than most,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Diaz was recently one of the 700 at-risk patients at Nicklaus Children&#8217;s Hospital to get the COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this shot, I&#8217;m more comfortable applying for housing for next year,&#8221; Diaz said.</p>
<p>Those older than 21 and under the medical care of a pediatrician or pediatric specialist are being evaluated on a case-by-case basis, hospital officials said.</p>
<p>Nicklaus Children&#8217;s Hospital Chief Medical Officer Dr. Marcos Mestre said most children handle COVID-19 well and that this vaccination is more about teenagers helping the older at-risk population.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know adolescents don&#8217;t always like to follow the rules and like to hang out together and whatnot, so it also helps in terms of preventing the spread,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Mestre said for many kids, including Diaz, the vaccine means freedom.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very common that I get a response that the family, after they&#8217;ve received the vaccine, have tears of joy because they&#8217;ve been locked up so long with their child who&#8217;s at risk, and they&#8217;d do anything for their child, so once they get that for their child, they feel like they&#8217;re seeing the light at end of the tunnel,&#8221; said Dr. Mestre.</p>
<p>Any Florida resident 16 to 21 who is at risk can register to receive the vaccine at Nicklaus Children&#8217;s Hospital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the race to vaccinate speeds up, a big worry to local leaders are the crowds that come with the spring break season.</p>
<p>Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale are cities where spring breakers usually flock to, and local leaders are urging visitors and residents to be safe.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very worried that there&#8217;s going to be a convergence of people here and a real problem in the aftermath after that,&#8221; said Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber.</p>
<p>&#8220;If everyone follows the rules and stays 6 feet away from each other, wears their masks in the bars, things like that can definitely keep from spreading it,&#8221; said resident Yann Meyjonade.</p>
<p>Last weekend, beaches were crowded, and the crowds are expected to grow this coming weekend.</p>
<p>In Miami Beach, officials are restricting the beaches normal open hours to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and sidewalk cafes will close at midnight. No inflatable devices, tents, tables, loud music or coolers are allowed on the beach.</p>
<p>In Fort Lauderdale, no Lyfts or Ubers are allowed along A1A, which is usually congested during spring break. Barricades have been set up to help keep pedestrians safe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seeing all the gates like that is something I haven&#8217;t seen before,&#8221; said Meyjonade.</p>
<p>No alcohol is allowed on the beach, as well.</p>
<p>Signage has been put up in hotspot areas to remind people to follow the rules that have been in place for almost a year. These include maintaining social distancing and wearing masks.</p>
<p>Some residents said the crowds are significantly smaller in 2021 compared to past years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not near the number of people this year as it was last year,&#8221; said resident Roy Moore.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a little shocked at how packed it was, especially last night for being a Thursday,&#8221; said visitor Paula Coleman. &#8220;Other than that, you know, we&#8217;re just kind of getting our feet wet here today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miami-Dade County has a curfew in effect for spring break that starts at midnight and runs until 6 a.m.</p>
<p>Broward County officials debated implementing a curfew but decided against it. They said, however, if any business or restaurant breaks the rules put in place, they are at risk of being shut down.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A South Florida visitor is speaking out hours after his truck was caught in the crossfire of a <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/man-transported-after-shooting-outside-hotel-in-miami/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shootout outside his hotel</a>, sending a man to the hospital.</p>
<p>Robert Kovacs showed 7News a bullet hole in his vehicle near the Marriott on Bayshore Drive in Miami.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is where the bullet hit,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Kovacs, who is visiting from Connecticut, said he heard gunfire early Thursday morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;At first I heard the shooting, like a single shot, and then I heard an automatic gun,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>One bullet damaged his windshield and shattered his back window.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my car. I mean, this is what I&#8217;m driving. This thing is &#8211; it&#8217;s destroyed now,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>City of Miami Police said bullets went flying just feet from the hotel.</p>
<p>“Shortly after 3:30 this morning, a large group of individuals was coming out of the marina area,” said City of Miami Police Cmdr. Freddie Cruz. “Some sort of argument ensued, and shots were fired.”</p>
<p>Cruz said a victim was not found at the scene, but a man with gunshot wounds was dropped off at Jackson Memorial Hospital.</p>
<p>“I can tell you that we do have one individual right now in critical but stable condition at the hospital. It’s a young man in his 20s,” he said. “We have a female who was physically beaten.”</p>
<p>Also struck during the gunfire exchange was Trinity Cathedral, located just across the street from the hotel.</p>
<p>7News cameras captured a bullet hole left in one of the church’s stained glass windows.</p>
<p>The shooting has left area residents on edge.</p>
<p>“It was a little concerning, just like, wow, you know?” said Luis Perna. “Definitely you’ve got to be careful.”</p>
<p>As for Kovacs, his focus now is fixing his truck and heading back home. He said he is counting his blessings that he was not hurt.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was kind of scary. I&#8217;m happy I was not nearby,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>If you have any information on this shooting or the gunman’s whereabouts, call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS. Remember, you can always remain anonymous, and you may be eligible for a $1,000 reward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new vaccination site in Sweetwater is now distributing doses.</p>
<p>The city administered shots at Ronselli Park, on Southwest 114th Avenue and Second Street, Thursday, and 500 doses will be administered daily through next Wednesday.</p>

<p>Sweetwater Mayor Orlando Lopez said he has high hopes for what the site can get done.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Firefighters have extinguished a fire that sparked at a home in Northwest Miami-Dade, and they also saved a dog that was trapped inside.</p>
<p>Peggy Worsley arrived at the home on Northwest 26th Avenue and 67th Street, Thursday afternoon, to find Miami-Dade Fire Rescue crews on the scene and Chi Chi, one of her three dogs, stuck inside.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if it started in the laundry room or in the kitchen, so I don&#8217;t know for sure,&#8221; Worsley, who lives in the home, said. &#8220;They heard the dog inside the house, couldn&#8217;t find the dog, so they went from room to room, and the dog kept on making noise, and they found the dog under the bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crews located the missing dog and rushed the canine out of the home. Worsley said the dog was unresponsive. 7Skyforce hovered overhead as crews worked to feed the dog oxygen.</p>
<p>&#8220;They brought the dog out, laid him down, oxygen, and, like, for 15 minutes, they were trying to get him oxygen, and he came back,&#8221; Worsley said. &#8220;I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Yes! My dog!&#8217; Because my youngest daughter, her and my dog have a good bond.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cameras captured Chi Chi lapping at his owner&#8217;s hand happily after he was pulled from the burning home. Worsley&#8217;s two other dogs, named Tupac and Biggie, were also safe, and officials said they were outside at the time of the fire.</p>
<p>A hole was spotted on the home&#8217;s roof from 7Skyforce. Visible smoke damage could be seen on the walls inside of the home, and parts of the ceiling have come down.</p>
<p>&#8220;We pretty much lost everything,&#8221; Worsley said. &#8220;Everything is pretty much demolished. We&#8217;re good. We got somewhere to go, something to eat, so no complaints, and start over tomorrow. Tomorrow is another day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The family said they are thankful their family members and dogs are OK. Firefighters also posed for a photo with Chi Chi before they left the scene.</p>
<p>Fire crews said a cooking fire at the back of the house sparked the blaze, and no other injuries were reported.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Florida will allow teachers of any age to get vaccinated at any federally-supported site thanks to a new directive from President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Long lines could be seen at the vaccination site at Miami-Dade College&#8217;s North Campus on Thursday, the second day the site began operating. The site administered 1,500 vaccine doses on the first day it opened. Appointments are <a href="https://www.floridadisaster.org/globalassets/covid19/vaccine-info/federally-supported-sites-overview.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not required at the site</a>, but they are recommended.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you work or teach from pre-K to 12th grade, high school &#8212; whether you&#8217;re a teacher or a staffer or employee there &#8212; if you have your ID card, you can come to a FEMA supported site, and you can be vaccinated,&#8221; Mike Jachles, the chair of the Florida Association of Public Information Officers, said.</p>
<p>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced the change as part of the president&#8217;s mandate requiring states to vaccinate K-12 teachers and staff. Pharmacies throughout South Florida <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/cvs-set-to-vaccinate-teachers-school-staff-following-directive-from-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be doing the same</a>.</p>
<p>People at MDC North&#8217;s vaccination site can choose between the two-dose Pfizer-BioNTech and single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines. The site is open every day from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.</p>
<p>A total of 2,800 vaccine doses were administered on Thursday out of the allotted 3,000 doses. They also ran out of the allotted Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine for the day, but they still had Pfizer vaccines available. The White House Coronavirus Task Force plans to double the daily amount of doses at federally-supported sites to 6,000.</p>
<p>Florida will also allow anyone over 18 years old with serious underlying health conditions to receive the vaccine if they <a href="http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/covid-physician-form/EO-21-47-Form.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fill out a form signed by a physician</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, if you&#8217;re 65 and over, if you meet the other criteria &#8212; firefighter, law enforcement 50 and over, or a schoolteacher or employee ages 18 and over, or the medically vulnerable with a form &#8212; you can come here, get vaccinated and hopefully, get in and out of here very quickly,&#8221; Jachles said.</p>
<p>Octavia Edwards has been a teacher for over 20 years, and she hopes receiving the vaccine will help things return to normal.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard through a family member,&#8221; Edwards said. &#8220;She called, and she said, &#8216;Governor DeSantis just opened it up for all teachers,&#8217; so I was excited and came right over. That will help teachers to feel more comfortable going into the school, and it will also help parents to also feel more comfortable knowing the teachers are vaccinated, and their kids are safe with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I just left school, drove right here, kind of got here, took about 40 minutes from getting in line to getting the shot and walking out,&#8221; teacher Joseph Goodman said. &#8220;It was super quick and easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>DeSantis is working to expand access and eligibility to anyone who wants to receive the vaccine in the state.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to do even more Walgreens in the coming weeks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think that will be particularly important when we get to a point where we can lower the age to below 65, which is going to happen relatively soon, certainly this month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t even express how excited and happy I am,&#8221; Marla Gelbard, who got vaccinated on Thursday, said. &#8220;Time is life, and this is a way back to life.&#8221;</p>
<p>For veterans in Miami-Dade, Broward and Monroe counties, the Miami VA Healthcare System announced they are providing the COVID-19 vaccine to all veterans, regardless of age. No appointments are required, but officials recommend people book one.</p>
<p>At the Sweetwater and Florida City mobile sites, just under half of the allotted 1,000 vaccines were distributed on Thursday.</p>
<p>Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava is expected to visit the federally-supported site on Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re super excited,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The feds have come to town. We&#8217;ve got so much more vaccine. There is hope. There is light at the end. We hope that everybody will be vaccinated by May, and we can get back to some kind of normalcy, but we need to stay protected.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mayor added the county is getting close to vaccinating 50,000 per week.</p>
<p>For those who want to make sure they get a dose when they arrive, officials said people can pre-register for an appointment through Florida’s statewide registration system at <a href="https://myvaccine.fl.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myvaccine.fl.gov</a> or by calling Miami-Dade County’s designated scheduling hotline at 888-499-0840.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police have arrested a man accused of aiming a laser at airplanes en route to and taking off from a major South Florida airport, and they don&#8217;t think it was the only time he committed the crime.</p>
<p>In bond court Thursday morning, 61-year-old Rolando Yague stood before Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Judigh K. Rubenstein as she read his charges.</p>
<p>&#8220;One count of misuse of a laser lighting device,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Officials said Yague used a green laser pointer and shone it into the cockpits of airplanes as they took off from and landed at Miami International Airport for about a year.</p>
<p>Investigators were eventually able to pinpoint the laser to a neighborhood located a mile and a half east of MIA.</p>
<p>Police said Yague was outside walking his dog and took out the laser pointer when he saw a plane flying above him and pointed it at the aircraft.</p>
<p>In the arrest report, detectives described the pointer as &#8220;an apparatus which is used to shine into the cockpit of aircraft and cause impairment to the aircraft and the pilots operating the aircraft.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police said the first incident was reported in March of 2020. Several reports followed for a year.</p>
<p>Officers said the act is significantly dangerous to passengers on planes as well as surrounding communities because it has the potential to cause the plane to crash because the glare from the laser makes it difficult for the flight crew to see.</p>
<p>7SkyForce pilot Joe Mancino echoed officials&#8217; concerns.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very serious. A laser shined in the cockpit could blind a pilot,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Mancino, who has decades of flying experience and has spent 15 years flying SkyForce, said Yague could have put flight crews and passengers in danger.</p>
<p>&#8220;He could have caused dangerous conditions for countless people,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Police said Yague had an additional device, which he used when shining his laser.</p>
<p>According to the Federal Aviation Administration, there were 266 confirmed reports in 2020 of someone pointing a laser at an aircraft in Florida alone. Forty of those incidents happened in South Florida.</p>
<p>Yague is currently being held on $5,000 bond. He is also facing several additional charges out of Polk County.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police are investigating after, they said, a dispute outside of a hotel in Miami ended in gunfire, sending a man to the hospital.</p>
<p>City of Miami Police responded to the scene just off North Bayshore Drive in front of the Marriott Hotel, at around 4 a.m., Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost like a semi-automatic weapon being fired,&#8221; said Luis Perna, who heard the gunshots.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought like a firework or something like that,&#8221; said Abdul Salds. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t expecting it was going to be like a shooting, but it was like nine to 10 [shots] at different times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shortly after 3:30 this morning, a large group of individuals was coming out of the marina area. It&#8217;s still unclear if they were on a boat, or if they were just at the marina area,&#8221; said City of Miami Police Cmdr. Freddie Cruz. &#8220;Some sort of argument ensued, and shots were fired.&#8221;</p>
<p>7News cameras captured evidence markers on the street where several shell casings were found.</p>
<p>Cruz said a victim was not found at the scene but a man with gunshot wounds was dropped off at Jackson Memorial Hospital.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have one individual right now in critical but stable condition at the hospital. It&#8217;s a young man in his 20s,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have a female who was physically beaten.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Extremely surprising, yeah,&#8221; said Josh Adams, a hotel guest at the Marriott. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect this, like, I&#8217;m trying to go to sleep, you know? I just worked all night. I want to go to sleep now, and I can&#8217;t even go to my hotel room.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crime scene tape was put up at a second scene, the Trinity Cathedral, located just across the street from the hotel.</p>
<p>7News cameras captured a bullet hole left in one of the church&#8217;s stained glass windows.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate when violence happens,&#8221; said Adams. &#8220;I just don&#8217;t want no one to get hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a little concerning, just like, wow, you know?&#8221; said Perna. &#8220;Definitely you&#8217;ve got to be careful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know if all these individuals were together, if indeed it might have been a robbery. We&#8217;re not exactly sure,&#8221; said Cruz. &#8220;We did open up Bayshore as of right now, but we&#8217;re reviewing cameras, talking to several witnesses that heard these gunshots. Something very uncommon for this area, very quiet area.&#8221;</p>
<p>When asked if he believes the incident had anything to do with visitors in the area, Cruz replied, &#8220;Everything is possible at this point. We don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re local. We don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re visiting from somewhere else. Again, if anybody has any information, anybody heard anything and wants to come forward, please, all the assistance would be great.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you have any information on this shooting or the gunman&#8217;s whereabouts, call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS. Remember, you can always remain anonymous, and you may be eligible for a $1,000 reward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police have arrested two men, each accused of attacking an employee at separate Miami Beach hotels, and one of them was captured by a surveillance camera.</p>
<p>Mandy Calara, the owner of Voodoo Lounge in Miami Beach, was arrested after he allegedly attacked an employee at the Clinton Hotel. He <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-dade/voodoo-lounge-owner-bonds-out-of-jail-after-allegedly-attacking-miami-beach-hotel-employee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bonded out</a> of the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center in West Miami-Dade on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m gonna get an attorney and go through a little bit more of the details later,&#8221; Calara said shortly after his release.</p>
<p>According to police, Calara went to the hotel&#8217;s front desk to demand a key to his friend&#8217;s room. When the clerk refused because he was not a guest, Calara allegedly became aggressive and attacked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The victim went to call 911. The defendant went behind the front desk, struck the victim,&#8221; a prosecutor said in court on Wednesday. &#8220;There was a struggle. The defendant struck the victim multiple times to the head with a closed fist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Miami Beach Police worked another attack at a different hotel that led to an arrest in Philadelphia. The attack happened at the Riviera South Beach Hotel on Feb. 12.</p>
<p>The suspect, identified as Tehrron Greene, could be seen going behind the counter to a back room before he begins punching and beating the hotel&#8217;s manager. The victim in that attack was left with severe injuries to his head, detectives said.</p>
<p>According to police, the attack stemmed from an issue with a credit card.</p>
<p>Detectives used Facebook to track down Greene. Once they spoke to him, detectives said Greene confessed to the attack. He is expected to be extradited to South Florida to face charges related to the attack.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The owner of a South Beach lounge has posted bond after he was arrested for allegedly attacking a hotel employee in Miami Beach.</p>
<p>Mandy Calara, who owns Voodoo Lounge in Miami Beach, bonded out of the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center, Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>When asked if he beat up the hotel employee as he walked out of jail, Calara responded, &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna get an attorney and go through a little bit more of the details later.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to police, Calara went to the front desk of the Clinton Hotel and demanded a key to his friend&#8217;s room. When the clerk refused because he was not a guest, Calara allegedly became aggressive.</p>
<p>&#8220;The victim asked the defendant to leave multiple times. The defendant became verbally aggressive,&#8221; a prosecutor said during court, Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>From there, the situation turned physical.</p>
<p>&#8220;The victim went to call 911. The defendant went behind the front desk, struck the victim,&#8221; a prosecutor said. &#8220;There was a struggle. The defendant struck the victim multiple times to the head with a closed fist.&#8221;</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t stop there.</p>
<p>&#8220;The victim goes outside to take a picture of the vehicle, and the defendant tackles the victim and begins striking the victim again in the face. The defendant then flees the scene,&#8221; a prosecutor said.</p>
<p>Calara was arrested soon after and posted $10,000 bond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A surveillance camera captured a man stealing a tip jar from the counter at a Hialeah gas station.</p>
<p>The theft happened at a Chevron gas station at the corner of Northwest 68th Street and Fourth Avenue, Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>Mayra, an employee, was working at the time the man took off with the jar, which contained about $30 in cash.</p>
<p>&#8220;He went to get a soda and some chips,&#8221; she said in Spanish.</p>
<p>Soon after, the man waited in line to pay for the items. Mayra scanned the snacks, as the crook swiped his credit card, but seconds later, he grabbed the tip jar and bolted out the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;He left very quickly,&#8221; Mayra said in Spanish.</p>
<p>Mayra added she did not know what to do because it happened so fast. The snacks were left behind, and the man got away in a light-colored Toyota Corolla.</p>
<p>The store employee also said the man should work for his own money instead of stealing from others.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in a pandemic. We&#8217;re living in a difficult moment,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Mayra is not concerned about the money, but rather, the principle behind the theft. She hopes the man feels guilty about stealing the tip jar and returns it.</p>
<p>If you have any information on this theft, call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS. Remember, you can always remain anonymous, and you may be eligible for a $1,000 reward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A man had to be hospitalized after he was shot in the middle of a street near a Miami school, causing the campus to be put on lockdown.</p>
<p>The shooting happened in the area of Northwest 75th Street and Second Avenue, in between St. Mary&#8217;s Cathedral and the parish&#8217;s school, Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;We never know what might be happening tomorrow or the day after tomorrow,&#8221; Guinel Dorvil, who was picking up his daughter, said. &#8220;Something serious must be done about that, so that won&#8217;t happen again.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to police, a man said to be in his 20s was driving a silver sedan when he was shot just before noon. They said that is what caused the man to crash a few blocks over, along 75th Street and North Miami Avenue.</p>
<p>Police said the man was rushed to Jackson Memorial Hospital by City of Miami Fire Rescue in stable condition, but it does not appear anyone else was injured.</p>
<p>The school was put on lockdown as a result of the shooting. A schoolteacher said she and her students heard gunshots from inside of their classroom.</p>
<p>Rich Wayne lives nearby and said scenes like Wednesday&#8217;s are not new to the area.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t bring my kid and let them play in the yard,&#8221; Wayne said. &#8220;How can I feel safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>A dark-colored car was involved in a crash with the man driving the silver sedan. The vehicle&#8217;s owner was captured walking near the intersection, seemingly upset about what happened.</p>
<p>If you have any information on this shooting, call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS. Remember, you can always remain anonymous, and you may be eligible for a $1,000 reward.</p>
