						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good Samaritans raced to help a woman and an elderly man minutes after, police said, they were <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-dade/search-underway-for-19-year-old-after-shooting-in-sw-miami-dade-leaves-1-dead-2-injured/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shot inside of a Southwest Miami-Dade home</a> during a domestic dispute that left a man dead and led to the arrest of a 19-year-old suspect.</p>
<p>Ring doorbell video captured area resident Lisa Pelaez and her husband rendering aid to a 74-year-old man moments after he fled the home, in the area of Southwest 142nd Avenue and 294th Street, Saturday morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s shooting up the house,&#8221; the man is heard saying in the video.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s still there?&#8221; asked Pelaez.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah!&#8221; said the man.</p>
<p>According to Miami-Dade Police, Ruben Warren Williams ran away after shooting three of his family members. His cousin, identified as 27-year-old Carlton Tillman, was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
<p>Detectives said four children were in the home when the shots rang out.</p>
<p>“According to investigators, there was a verbal dispute inside of the residence that escalated and led to shots fired,” said MDPD detective Khristopher Welch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were so scared,&#8221; said Pelaez.</p>
<p>Investigators said Williams&#8217; grandfather had asked him not to smoke marijuana in the house, and that led to an argument.</p>
<p>Police said Williams became angry and opened fire, striking Tillman, his grandfather and his aunt.</p>
<p>Detectives said the suspect&#8217;s aunt and grandfather jumped from a second-floor window. The grandfather broke both his ankles, and even still, both he and the suspect&#8217;s aunt ran for help.</p>
<p>Pelaez, who lives two doors down, said the older victim headed to her home.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aunt, who jumped out of the second-story building, went this way, and the grandfather went this way to my house,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I opened the door immediately. He said, &#8216;I&#8217;ve been shot. My grandson shot me; he&#8217;s shooting everybody.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Pelaez said she immediately called 911 and tried to treat his wounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;My husband ran and grabbed a towel from our closet, he put the towel on his back, on the gunshot wound,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I ran in the house, and I grabbed a chair, and we sat him down on the chair. The grandfather said, &#8216;My legs broke, my legs broke,&#8217; and I&#8217;m asking the grandfather, &#8216;Where&#8217;s the lady, where&#8217;s the lady?'&#8221;</p>
<p>Surveillance video captured Williams&#8217; aunt as she limped to a nearby home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I picked her up, and I put her to the side of the house to try and hide her body,&#8221; said a resident at this home. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know where the guy was at the time. In that short instant, the paramedics came, so they were able to take over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police said <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-dade/19-year-old-arrested-charged-with-murder-in-shooting-that-left-man-dead-2-others-injured/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Williams was arrested Saturday</a> after he hopped into a woman&#8217;s car and forced her to drive for hours at gunpoint.</p>
<p>Investigators said the suspect also shot and killed a neighbor&#8217;s dog during the rampage.</p>
<p>Neighbors said they&#8217;re thankful for Williams&#8217; quick capture.</p>
<p>&#8220;My friends and my family and I are so relieved, you do not understand,&#8221; said Pelaez.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, that&#8217;s good. Hopefully the lady survives,&#8221; said the resident who helped Williams&#8217; aunt.</p>
<p>Williams is facing multiple charges, including second-degree murder, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, child abuse and animal cruelty with intent to injure or kill.</p>
<p>As of Sunday night, police have not identified the surviving victims, who remain at Jackson South Medical Center. Their conditions are currently unknown.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FLORIDA CITY, Fla. (AP/WSVN) &#8212; A South Florida vaccination site had so few eligible takers Saturday that it started inoculating any adult who wanted a shot rather than let the vaccine on hand go to waste.</p>
<p>Word spread, and on Sunday, the Florida City site was overwhelmed, particularly after local state Sen. Annette Taddeo incorrectly tweeted that the federally run site would again take all comers. The Democrat, who was the party&#8217;s lieutenant governor candidate in 2014, later deleted that tweet and corrected herself.</p>
<p>Frustration and confusion set in among the hundreds of people who came to the site run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>
<p>Among those were Kathy Benezra.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite upset. They changed the rules in the morning,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Police had to calm the crowd when the site again enforced the state&#8217;s eligibility rules: 65 and older; frontline medical workers and police officers, teachers and firefighters over 50; and younger people with a physician&#8217;s note saying they would be endangered if they caught the virus.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article249760473.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Miami Herald</a>, a Florida City police officer through a megaphone told 200 people waiting in line, “If you do not meet the criteria, you will not be vaccinated today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people went away once they heard the criteria, but [the line] was all the way around the block,&#8221; said Benezra.</p>
<p>Benezra said she got there at around 7 a.m. because she heard the site was giving vaccinations to anyone over the age of 18 who wanted one.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been here, and now the rules have changed,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The confusion appeared to stem from what happened on Saturday.</p>
<p>Vaccines must be refrigerated at extremely cold temperatures and used that day once they are removed. Rather than letting doses go to waste, workers on Saturday reportedly began giving them out to any adult regardless of profession or medical history.</p>
<p>That is not unusual &#8211; many drugstores, for example, will inject anyone in the store at closing time if they have leftover vaccines that would spoil otherwise.</p>
<p>Word of what reportedly happened at the Florida City site quickly spread online, and people came from miles to the small town on the Florida peninsula&#8217;s southern tip to get their shots.</p>
<p>The FEMA-run site administers 500 doses per day.</p>
<p>Mike Jachles with the Florida Association of Public Information Officers issued a statement that reads in part, &#8220;The FEMA-supported sites are adhering to the governor&#8217;s most recent executive order.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many who met the eligibility requirements received their vaccine doses at the larger FEMA-run site at Miami-Dade College&#8217;s North Campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very easy, and I&#8217;m very happy to live in this country,&#8221; said patient Magda Caceres..</p>
<p>&#8220;Super quick, super easy,&#8221; said patient Viviane Carneiro.</p>
<p>Schoolteachers and school employees of all ages are also eligible at FEMA-supported sites.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once the governor opened it up to teachers, I&#8217;m like, &#8216;I&#8217;m out here as soon as I can,'&#8221; said Angel Beswick.</p>
<p>For her, the MDC site was the happiest place on Earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels like I&#8217;m at Disney World, honestly. I&#8217;m so excited,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>As the race to vaccinate continues, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava urged the governor to <a href="https://twitter.com/MayorDaniella/status/1368636288170139648?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expand eligibility requirements</a>.</p>
<p>Sunday night, state officials reported 3,878 vaccinations at the three FEMA-run sites in South Florida. Of these inoculations, 3,160 took place at the MDC North Campus site, 321 at the Florida City site and 397 at the site located in Sweetwater.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring breakers spotted without face masks at two popular South Florida destinations have raised concerns that the gatherings could lead to an increase in coronavirus cases.</p>
<p>This weekend brought <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/local-leaders-urge-spring-breakers-to-social-distance-wear-masks-as-crowds-grow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more large crowds</a> to Fort Lauderdale Beach. 7News cameras captured many revelers not wearing masks or following COVID protocols.</p>
<p>More maskless beachgoers were spotted Sunday in Miami Beach.</p>
<p>That city&#8217;s leaders are hoping to keep things calm by <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-beach-fort-lauderdale-implement-rules-and-safety-guidelines-as-spring-break-begins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closing beaches</a> at 7 p.m. and ordering businesses along the beach to shut down by midnight.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The owner of a freight forwarding business in Doral is reeling hours after thieves were caught on surveillance video driving away with a 23-foot boat in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Nelson Gonzalez of MVP International Freight Systems spoke with 7News on Saturday about the overnight theft of a 23-foot Robalo.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was actually shipping to our customer in Aruba,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a big deal to a big customer, and not only that; in these trying times, freight forwarding has suffered a lot. This affects us a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gonzalez said he left the family-owned business at around midnight on Friday, and not long after, someone started scoping it out.</p>
<p>About an hour and a half later, Gonzalez said, the crooks made their move.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thank God we had cameras, and we have cameras from different angles in every single part of this warehouse, so we were able to take pictures and post them out,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The surveillance video captured a pickup truck backing up. Someone is seen getting out and hitching the boat onto the truck.</p>
<p>Three minutes later, the thieves drove off with the boat in tow.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw that it&#8217;s a Ford F-150 extended cab &#8212; it&#8217;s a workman&#8217;s truck &#8212; and it had a spotter,&#8221; said Gonzalez, &#8220;so a spotter was actually spotting with them, and he was driving a Ford Focus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Gonzalez is hoping someone is able to get the vessel back where it belongs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all trying to feed our families. We&#8217;re all trying to keep our employees afloat, so any business, anything that we get, we have to make the best out of it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and this is not just a hard blow to us. This also [affects] our customers who live on the islands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gonzalez said his customer in Aruba is now out about $12,000.</p>
<p>If you have any information on this theft, call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS. Remember, you can always remain anonymous, and you may be eligible for a $1,000 reward.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good Samaritans raced to help a woman and an elderly man minutes after, police said, they were <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-dade/search-underway-for-19-year-old-after-shooting-in-sw-miami-dade-leaves-1-dead-2-injured/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shot inside of a Southwest Miami-Dade home</a> during a domestic dispute that left a man dead and led to the arrest of a 19-year-old suspect.</p>
<p>Ring doorbell video captured area resident Lisa Pelaez and her husband rendering aid to a 74-year-old man moments after he fled the home, in the area of Southwest 142nd Avenue and 294th Street, Saturday morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s shooting up the house,&#8221; the man is heard saying in the video.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s still there?&#8221; asked Pelaez.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah!&#8221; said the man.</p>
<p>According to Miami-Dade Police, Ruben Warren Williams ran away after shooting three of his family members. His cousin, identified as 27-year-old Carlton Tillman, was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
<p>Detectives said four children were in the home when the shots rang out.</p>
<p>“According to investigators, there was a verbal dispute inside of the residence that escalated and led to shots fired,” said MDPD detective Khristopher Welch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were so scared,&#8221; said Pelaez.</p>
<p>Investigators said Williams&#8217; grandfather had asked him not to smoke marijuana in the house, and that led to an argument.</p>
<p>Police said Williams became angry and opened fire, striking Tillman, his grandfather and his aunt.</p>
<p>Detectives said the suspect&#8217;s aunt and grandfather jumped from a second-floor window. The grandfather broke both his ankles, and even still, both he and the suspect&#8217;s aunt ran for help.</p>
<p>Pelaez, who lives two doors down, said the older victim headed to her home.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aunt, who jumped out of the second-story building, went this way, and the grandfather went this way to my house,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I opened the door immediately. He said, &#8216;I&#8217;ve been shot. My grandson shot me; he&#8217;s shooting everybody.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Pelaez said she immediately called 911 and tried to treat his wounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;My husband ran and grabbed a towel from our closet, he put the towel on his back, on the gunshot wound,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I ran in the house, and I grabbed a chair, and we sat him down on the chair. The grandfather said, &#8216;My legs broke, my legs broke,&#8217; and I&#8217;m asking the grandfather, &#8216;Where&#8217;s the lady, where&#8217;s the lady?'&#8221;</p>
<p>Surveillance video captured Williams&#8217; aunt as she limped to a nearby home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I picked her up, and I put her to the side of the house to try and hide her body,&#8221; said a resident at this home. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know where the guy was at the time. In that short instant, the paramedics came, so they were able to take over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police said <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-dade/19-year-old-arrested-charged-with-murder-in-shooting-that-left-man-dead-2-others-injured/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Williams was arrested Saturday</a> after he hopped into a woman&#8217;s car and forced her to drive for hours at gunpoint.</p>
<p>Investigators said the suspect also shot and killed a neighbor&#8217;s dog during the rampage.</p>
<p>Neighbors said they&#8217;re thankful for Williams&#8217; quick capture.</p>
<p>&#8220;My friends and my family and I are so relieved, you do not understand,&#8221; said Pelaez.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, that&#8217;s good. Hopefully the lady survives,&#8221; said the resident who helped Williams&#8217; aunt.</p>
<p>Williams is facing multiple charges, including second-degree murder, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, child abuse and animal cruelty with intent to injure or kill.</p>
<p>As of Sunday night, police have not identified the surviving victims, who remain at Jackson South Medical Center. Their conditions are currently unknown.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring breakers spotted without face masks at two popular South Florida destinations have raised concerns that the gatherings could lead to an increase in coronavirus cases.</p>
<p>This weekend brought <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/local-leaders-urge-spring-breakers-to-social-distance-wear-masks-as-crowds-grow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more large crowds</a> to Fort Lauderdale Beach. 7News cameras captured many revelers not wearing masks or following COVID protocols.</p>
<p>More maskless beachgoers were spotted Sunday in Miami Beach.</p>
<p>That city&#8217;s leaders are hoping to keep things calm by <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-beach-fort-lauderdale-implement-rules-and-safety-guidelines-as-spring-break-begins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closing beaches</a> at 7 p.m. and ordering businesses along the beach to shut down by midnight.</p>
<p>Anyone with questions and concerns about the coronavirus can call the Florida Department of Health&#8217;s 24-hour hotline at 1-866-779-6121.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring breakers spotted without face masks at two popular South Florida destinations have raised concerns that the gatherings could lead to an increase in coronavirus cases.</p>

<p>More maskless beachgoers were spotted Sunday in Miami Beach.</p>
<p>That city&#8217;s leaders are hoping to keep things calm by <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-beach-fort-lauderdale-implement-rules-and-safety-guidelines-as-spring-break-begins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closing beaches</a> at 7 p.m. and ordering businesses along the beach to shut down by midnight.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2021 Broward Heart Walk Digital Experience kicked off this weekend at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale.</p>
<p>The events local sponsors &#8212; City Furniture, Cleveland Clinic Florida and Rick Case Automotive Group &#8212; raised money for a good cause.</p>
<p>The walk benefits the American Heart Association, a nonprofit that funds research and helps bring awareness to cardiovascular issues.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re hoping that the Broward Heart Walk will raise over $1.5 million this year for The American Heart Association,&#8221; said Andrew Koenig, president of City Furniture. &#8220;They&#8217;re going to put that money to great use: for life-saving research, very critical important awareness, to really save lives, and create happier and healthier lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s event was held in memory of Rick Case. The late community leader helped the Heart Walk reach fundraising goals for many years.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FLORIDA CITY, Fla. (AP/WSVN) &#8212; A South Florida vaccination site had so few eligible takers Saturday that it started inoculating any adult who wanted a shot rather than let the vaccine on hand go to waste.</p>
<p>Word spread, and on Sunday, the Florida City site was overwhelmed, particularly after local state Sen. Annette Taddeo incorrectly tweeted that the federally run site would again take all comers. The Democrat, who was the party&#8217;s lieutenant governor candidate in 2014, later deleted that tweet and corrected herself.</p>
<p>Frustration and confusion set in among the hundreds of people who came to the site run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>
<p>Among those were Kathy Benezra.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite upset. They changed the rules in the morning,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Police had to calm the crowd when the site again enforced the state&#8217;s eligibility rules: 65 and older; frontline medical workers and police officers, teachers and firefighters over 50; and younger people with a physician&#8217;s note saying they would be endangered if they caught the virus.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article249760473.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Miami Herald</a>, a Florida City police officer through a megaphone told 200 people waiting in line, “If you do not meet the criteria, you will not be vaccinated today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people went away once they heard the criteria, but [the line] was all the way around the block,&#8221; said Benezra.</p>
<p>Benezra said she got there at around 7 a.m. because she heard the site was giving vaccinations to anyone over the age of 18 who wanted one.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been here, and now the rules have changed,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The confusion appeared to stem from what happened on Saturday.</p>
<p>Vaccines must be refrigerated at extremely cold temperatures and used that day once they are removed. Rather than letting doses go to waste, workers on Saturday reportedly began giving them out to any adult regardless of profession or medical history.</p>
<p>That is not unusual &#8211; many drugstores, for example, will inject anyone in the store at closing time if they have leftover vaccines that would spoil otherwise.</p>
<p>Word of what reportedly happened at the Florida City site quickly spread online, and people came from miles to the small town on the Florida peninsula&#8217;s southern tip to get their shots.</p>
<p>The FEMA-run site administers 500 doses per day.</p>
<p>Mike Jachles with the Florida Association of Public Information Officers issued a statement that reads in part, &#8220;The FEMA-supported sites are adhering to the governor&#8217;s most recent executive order.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many who met the eligibility requirements received their vaccine doses at the larger FEMA-run site at Miami-Dade College&#8217;s North Campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very easy, and I&#8217;m very happy to live in this country,&#8221; said patient Magda Caceres..</p>
<p>&#8220;Super quick, super easy,&#8221; said patient Viviane Carneiro.</p>
<p>Schoolteachers and school employees of all ages are also eligible at FEMA-supported sites.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once the governor opened it up to teachers, I&#8217;m like, &#8216;I&#8217;m out here as soon as I can,'&#8221; said Angel Beswick.</p>
<p>For her, the MDC site was the happiest place on Earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels like I&#8217;m at Disney World, honestly. I&#8217;m so excited,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>As the race to vaccinate continues, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava urged the governor to <a href="https://twitter.com/MayorDaniella/status/1368636288170139648?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expand eligibility requirements</a>.</p>
<p>Sunday night, state officials reported 3,878 vaccinations at the three FEMA-run sites in South Florida. Of these inoculations, 3,160 took place at the MDC North Campus site, 321 at the Florida City site and 397 at the site located in Sweetwater.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JUNO BEACH, Fla. (AP) — On a random Thursday night, restaurant server Kimberly Filion got the surprise of her life, not once but twice: two staggeringly high tips on otherwise modest checks. The tips, inspired by a national tip-off challenge that started among rival college basketball fans in Cincinnati, totaled to $2,800.</p>
<p>Filion, a single mother of four who has worked at Kirby’s Sports Grille in Juno Beach for the past six years, had never heard of the Crosstown Tip-Off Challenge that has revved up fans of University of Cincinnati and Xavier University since an Xavier Musketeers fan left a $1,000 tip at a local burger joint in January. Last week, a UC Bearcats fan in Wyoming, Ohio, left a $7,000 tip on a $65 check at a local Italian café.</p>
<p>The Juno Beach server learned about the challenge from a customer on that Thursday night, Feb. 18. Filion was fascinated, not only because she was a struggling server but because she had a personal connection to Ohio &#8212; she is a graduate of Ohio State University. She mentioned that in passing to the customer.</p>
<p>“And then he leaves a $1,300 tip on a $30 tab,” says Filion, 45, who also serves as Kirby’s bar manager.</p>
<p>The exact check amount was $29.71, but the server’s eyes went to the handwritten total &#8212; $1,329.71 &#8212; and the note scribbled beneath it, saying “Go XU!!”</p>
<p>The customer left another note as well: “Five Kelley Boys love Kirby’s in Juno Beach, FL! They cook your catch! Let’s go XU nation! Let’s get this to the national level!”</p>
<p>Filion says she ran after the customer when she saw the tip, but he was gone.</p>
<p>Floored, she recounted the incident later that evening to one of her regular customers. The guy had no particular loyalty to Xavier or to U.C., but he’s a big fan of Kirby’s bar. When Filion reviewed his check, she got her second shock of the night: a $1,500 tip on a $78 tab.</p>
<p>“He wrote something like, ‘I want to be the king,’” she says.</p>
<p>HELPING OTHERS</p>
<p>Filion shared her news with coworkers. Then she shared her tips with them.</p>
<p>“I tried to spread the wealth as much as I could,” she says. “We have employees here who are single moms. We have one employee who just had a baby.”</p>
<p>She knows their daily challenges have been made more severe during the pandemic. She knows this because this has been her struggle as well.</p>
<p>By the time her first big-tipping customer had taken his seat at Kirby’s bar that Thursday, Filion had run the daily marathon that is her life. She had made breakfast for her school-age kids, packed their lunches, spirited them to different schools, all on less than five hours of sleep.</p>
<p>As she does most days, the single mother of four raced through it all before heading in for her shift, which can run as late at 1:30 a.m.</p>
<p>Her boss, Sean Kirby, describes her as an “awesome” employee and “a hard worker.” And Filion says she loves her job.</p>
<p>“We have the most amazing, loyal customers ever. They make coming in so worthwhile,” says Filion.</p>
<p>The pay, however, doesn’t always love her back. She earns less than $5.40 an hour and relies on tips to boost her take-home pay to at least minimum-wage levels.</p>
<p>On the night of Feb. 18, the friendly customer at the bar asked her how business was going. Filion told him times were tough for the industry. She’s not one to chatter on about her woes to a customer. In fact, she sometimes refers to herself as “the therapist,” a sympathetic ear ready to listen to her customers vent. But that night, she vented a bit herself when the customer asked how things were.</p>
<p>“Everyone’s hurting. Honestly, I’m exhausted. I’m putting orange juice in my kids’ cereal,” she recalls telling the customer.</p>
<p>Kirby’s is a go-to neighborhood pub that’s locally famous for its meaty, Maryland-style crab cakes. The welcoming spot has been around for 17 years, but like many restaurants across the country, Kirby’s has lost a considerable amount of its dine-in crowd. The pub’s owner says the influx of newcomers moving to the area from the north is not translating into more customers.</p>
<p>“They’ll come to Florida. We see the traffic. But they’re not getting out,” says Kirby. “This is supposed to be our busiest time of the year.”</p>
<p>The pub has stepped up its takeout service and is expected to undergo renovations to create an open-sided dining area, he says.</p>
<p>But even as they pack more meals to go for takeout customers, servers like Filion too often see nothing for it in their take-home pay.</p>
<p>“You’d be surprised how many people don’t even leave a dollar &#8212; not one dollar &#8212; when they pick up their order. People are clueless sometimes. It is what it is. I’m working double time to make it up. I have to &#8212; I have four kids,” says Filion, who coaches her 7-year-old daughter’s soccer team on her days off.</p>
<p>She offers the example of a recent takeout order that totaled to $178.</p>
<p>“The customer says, ‘Can you help me put it in the trunk?’ Sure, no problem. And they just drive away, leaving nothing,” says Filion, a Long Island native who moved to Palm Beach County 13 years ago.</p>
<p>She started working as a server after her marriage broke up. In addition to her daily shuffle of mom duties, she was still nursing her youngest child when she got the job. “But you do what you have to do,” she says.</p>
<p>Then again, you might expect the daughter of the late Hall of Fame harness driver Hervé Filion to understand a thing or two about dealing with unpredictable shifts in pacing, in horses in life.</p>
<p>The way she deals with them is to take ownership, she says. For her, working at the pub is not just about completing her shifts, says Filion.</p>
<p>“This is your local, family-owned bar and it’s my home away from home. The people here are like my family. Some of my customers ask me if I live here. I tell them I sleep on top of the pool table,” she says. “People say, ‘Hey, are you the owner?’ I think that’s because I treat it as if it’s my place.”</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DELRAY BEACH, Fla. (WSVN) &#8212; A parade in Palm Beach County served as a special salute for seven veterans who were unable to go on an annual flight to the nation capital due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Palm Beach County Sheriff&#8217;s deputies and fire rescue vehicles took part in a caravan that drove past the veterans&#8217; homes, Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Honor Flight South Florida aimed to ensure some of the nation&#8217;s oldest veterans had an unforgettable reminder of how grateful people are for their service.</p>
<p>The vets were supposed to be passengers on an Honor Flight to Washington, D.C. last year. They would have had the chance to visit memorials that were built in honor of them and their fallen comrades.</p>
<p>But their trip was postponed due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>U.S. Army Lt. Col. Bill Schwartz, a World War II vet, was the parade&#8217;s grand marshal.</p>
<p>&#8220;To see this kind of a welcome, I mean, it&#8217;s overbearing, and it&#8217;s wonderful,&#8221; he said, &#8220;It&#8217;s a little icing on the cake for those who served.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schwartz was part of the first wave on Normandy Beach and one of the few to survive that D-Day battle.</p>
<p>The caravan started in Delray Beach and stopped at the homes of the veterans in the Boca Raton area, where their families and neighbors gathered to join in the celebration.</p>
<p>Honor Flight South Florida plans on a few more honor parades to pay tribute to more veterans who had to have their Honor Flights postponed.</p>
<p>The organization plans to bring back Honor Flights later in 2021, with the first ones scheduled to go out in September.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;The Masked Singer&#8221; isn&#8217;t resting on its laurels as Season 5 promises to deliver more mystery, clues, twists, turns and, of course, celebrities.</p>
<p>Robin Thicke and Jenny McCarthy gave us a sneak peek.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a new season on &#8220;The Masked Singer,&#8221; and this time, wild cards costumes could take a contestant&#8217;s spot.</p>
<p>A mystery celebrity, Cluedledoo, will be handing out hints.</p>
<p>Guest host Niecy Nash will kick things off, then Nick Cannon will return later in the season.</p>
<p>All the panelists are back, and McCarthy is ready to defend her golden ear.</p>
<p>Jenny McCarthy, reigning champion: &#8220;It&#8217;s a little tough, because Ken Jeong is not horrific at guessing this season. The only thing that I would say that I like to do in the past, I would go to escape rooms and practice figuring things out. I&#8217;d like to do that anyway, but since COVID I haven&#8217;t had the chance to do that, so I just have to rely on all the gossip magazines I&#8217;ve ever read and all the interviews I&#8217;ve done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thicke has a fun plan to challenge her.</p>
<p>Robin Thicke, laying it on Thicke: &#8220;I plan on cracking jokes every minute on the show. This season, I&#8217;ve decided to just be the class clown and have more fun than ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for guesses, both panelists have impressed themselves so far.</p>
<p>Robin Thicke: &#8220;I was proud that I got Busta Rhymes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jenny McCarthy: &#8220;Season 1 where I said, &#8216;Could be Cheech or Tommy Chong.'&#8221;</p>
<p>As for spoiler alerts for Season 5, McCarthy still thinks one of the masked contestants is Jamie Foxx.</p>
<p>Robin Thicke: &#8220;Jenny hasn&#8217;t gone a season without guessing Jamie Foxx, and Season 5 is no different, so tune in and find out who Jenny thinks Jamie Foxx is this year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just an FYI, Nash guest-hosted some of the episodes this season after Nick Cannon got COVID-19.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Masked Singer&#8221; is back on Wednesday right after Deco Drive.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So many movies, so little time. This week&#8217;s Showtime includes a talking sponge and a talking dragon, and those may not even be the weirdest movies of the bunch. Decide for yourself.</p>
<p>Leslie Jones (as Mary Junson): &#8220;He&#8217;s supposed to be like the Prince of Wakanda.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eddie Murphy (as Akeem): &#8220;Wakanda is a fictional place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leslie Jones (as Mary Junson): &#8220;Not to everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eddie Murphy is back in &#8220;Coming 2 America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thirty-three years after the original, Prince Akeem is now king, and when he learns he has a son back in New York, he&#8217;s off to track down the heir to the throne of Zamunda.</p>
<p>Eddie Murphy: &#8220;When I got the idea, and we got the writers, and we got it on paper, and we had a script, I was like, &#8216;OK, let&#8217;s go do it. I never felt pressure.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Holland (as Todd): &#8220;You know, you might not like my dog or want to hit me over the head or something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daisy Ridley (as Viola): &#8220;I like your dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>In &#8220;Chaos Walking,&#8221; Daisy Ridley crash-lands on a planet where all the women have disappeared.</p>
<p>On the plus side, Tom Holland lives here, but she can hear all men&#8217;s thoughts. All of them.</p>
<p>Deco asked Daisy if she can hack that in real life.</p>
<p>Daisy Ridley: &#8220;I&#8217;m quite a sensitive person, so I tend to pick up on stuff anyway, which is already stressful, because I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Oh, my God, just like live my life!'&#8221;</p>
<p>Kelly Marie Tran (as Raya): &#8220;Six years of searching. Please let this be it. Focus. Eyes forward, Tuk Tuk. Good boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>In &#8220;Raya and the Last Dragon,&#8221; evil forces have taken over.</p>
<p>Raya is a young warrior who needs to find and team up with the world&#8217;s last dragon so the two can save her homeland.</p>
<p>Taylor Takahashi (as Alfred &#8220;Boogie&#8221; Chin): &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to represent. I&#8217;ve got 5,000 years of Chinese history.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pop Smoke (as Monk): &#8220;That&#8217;s a lot of pressure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boogie&#8221; is about an Asian American high school basketball star who wants to score big in the NBA, but first he has to juggle his dreams with the stress of school and family.</p>
<p>Taylor Takahashi: &#8220;&#8216;Boogie&#8217; is a coming-of-age story set in New York, in the backdrop of New York, coming from an immigrant Taiwanese American family, and it&#8217;s the journey through his lens of New York City.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Kenny (as SpongeBob SquarePants): &#8220;I love my live. I love you so much, Gary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Kenny (as Gary): : &#8220;Ow.&#8221;</p>
<p>SpongeBob is on the trail of the snail in &#8220;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run.&#8221;</p>
<p>SpongeBob&#8217;s pet, Gary, is snail-napped, and SpongeBob goes on an epic adventure to get him back.</p>
<p>Character in &#8220;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run&#8221;: &#8220;Seize them!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Kenny (as SpongeBob SquarePants): &#8220;Patrick, what are you doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill Fagerbakke (as Patrick Star): &#8220;Free food!&#8221;</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Raya and the Last Dragon&#8221; is one for the history books. It&#8217;s Disney Animation&#8217;s first movie inspired by Southeast Asia. The stars are telling Deco how cool it is to be in the new film.</p>
<p>Kelly Marie Tran (as Raya): &#8220;My name is Raya. Our lands have been at war for as long as we can remember.&#8221;</p>
<p>Disney&#8217;s got itself a new princess with the movie &#8220;Raya and the Last Dragon,&#8221; and it&#8217;s safe to say Kelly Marie Tran was excited to score the role of the title character &#8212; meaning Raya, not the dragon.</p>
<p>Kelly Marie Tran: &#8220;I freaked out. Yeah, I was absolutely afraid of it. I think that, you know, we spend so much of our lives wishing and hoping and dreaming about these things, and then we don&#8217;t really think about what we&#8217;re gonna do when we get there, so there was definitely that moment for me, of just disbelief.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kelly Marie Tran (as Raya): &#8220;We really need your help.&#8221;</p>
<p>Awkwafina (as Sisu): &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be real with you. I&#8217;m not like the best dragon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Awkwafina voices the other title character: the dragon!</p>
<p>Awkwafina: &#8220;I always love playing relatable characters. I never really thought I&#8217;d find one in a dragon, and while Sisu is very, very cool, she&#8217;s also imperfect and flawed, and she&#8217;s aware of those flaws, and she&#8217;s very trusting and loving.&#8221;</p>
<p>The film&#8217;s fictional world draws from multiple Southeast Asian countries and influences. Representation is important!</p>
<p>Awkwafina: &#8220;I hope that some people can watch the movie and identify a familiarity about the places and the people and the things they&#8217;re seeing, and people who aren&#8217;t familiar with it will gain some kind of understanding of what that world is like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kelly Marie Tran: &#8220;It&#8217;s really been a dream come true to work on something of this scale that says something as important as I think it says.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kelly Marie Tran (as Raya): &#8220;Now, to restore peace, I must find the last dragon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raya and the Last Dragon&#8221; hits theaters Friday and will also be available as a &#8220;Premier Access&#8221; selection on Disney Plus.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mad3 for M3 makes music just for you. They&#8217;re a Miami-based trio with a cool mix of styles, and fans are catching on to their sexy sounds. Deco caught up with the band to find out what makes Mad3 for M3 made for us.</p>
<p>The members of Mad3 for M3 &#8212; Kiddo, PJ and Alex &#8212; are all behind-the-scenes veterans of the SoFlo music scene.</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s their time to shine.</p>
<p>Kiddo: &#8220;We&#8217;re studio rats, so we&#8217;re in the studio all the time making music for other people, and this project is ours, so we called it Mad3 for M3, and there&#8217;s a three in there &#8217;cause there&#8217;s three of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their time making music for other acts came in handy when they decided to record their own material.</p>
<p>Kiddo: &#8220;The flow was great &#8217;cause we just have such a good energy together. It wasn&#8217;t that difficult &#8217;cause we&#8217;ve been working together for years, so we already had an idea of how we worked.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group has some mighty interesting musical tastes.</p>
<p>Pj McGinnis: &#8220;I&#8217;m a big fan of Jazz music, especially like &#8217;50s Jazz, so Miles Davis, John Coltrane, but I also like metal a lot, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Forget about nailing the band to any one particular style. They&#8217;re not having any of that.</p>
<p>Alex Coombs: &#8220;Our sound is pretty much a fusion &#8212; like pop fusion. We try to take from like a bunch of different genres and whatnot.&#8221;</p>
<p>You got that right. There&#8217;s the perfect pop of &#8220;More than Friends,&#8221; the Brazilian-flavored &#8220;By Your Side&#8221; or the dreamy dance track, &#8220;Josephine.&#8221;</p>
<p>We wanted to find out if Mad3 for M3 sounded as good live, as they do in the studio.</p>
<p>We got our answer &#8212; oh yes, they do.</p>
<p>Kiddo (singing): &#8220;I wanna take you on the other side and go further than we did tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>The music of Mad3 for M3 reflects their many influences.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why they love representing the 305.</p>
<p>Alex Coombs: &#8220;South Florida is such a melting pot of different cultures. People tend to not realize that music is actually an influx of life, and we just transfer it out through notes.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can catch the band in action Friday night at 9 p.m. inside Taima in Doral.</p>
