										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring breakers spotted without face masks at two popular South Florida destinations have raised concerns that the gatherings could lead to an increase in coronavirus cases.</p>
<p>This weekend brought <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/local-leaders-urge-spring-breakers-to-social-distance-wear-masks-as-crowds-grow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more large crowds</a> to Fort Lauderdale Beach. 7News cameras captured many revelers not wearing masks or following COVID protocols.</p>
<p>More maskless beachgoers were spotted Sunday in Miami Beach.</p>
<p>That city&#8217;s leaders are hoping to keep things calm by <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-beach-fort-lauderdale-implement-rules-and-safety-guidelines-as-spring-break-begins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closing beaches</a> at 7 p.m. and ordering businesses along the beach to shut down by midnight.</p>
<p>Anyone with questions and concerns about the coronavirus can call the Florida Department of Health&#8217;s 24-hour hotline at 1-866-779-6121.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2021 Broward Heart Walk Digital Experience kicked off this weekend at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale.</p>
<p>The events local sponsors &#8212; City Furniture, Cleveland Clinic Florida and Rick Case Automotive Group &#8212; raised money for a good cause.</p>
<p>The walk benefits the American Heart Association, a nonprofit that funds research and helps bring awareness to cardiovascular issues.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re hoping that the Broward Heart Walk will raise over $1.5 million this year for The American Heart Association,&#8221; said Andrew Koenig, president of City Furniture. &#8220;They&#8217;re going to put that money to great use: for life-saving research, very critical important awareness, to really save lives, and create happier and healthier lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s event was held in memory of Rick Case. The late community leader helped the Heart Walk reach fundraising goals for many years.</p>

<p>Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said she is considering lifting the countywide curfew in early April if the positivity rate stays below a certain percentage, as new federal vaccination sites continue to increase access to the COVID-19 vaccine.<p>According to a spokesperson for the mayor, Levine Cava sent a memo to the county commissioners on Friday outlining her decision to lift the curfew by April 5 if current trends continue and the 14-day average is at or below 5.5% at that time.</p><div><embed type="oembed">https://twitter.com/MayorDaniella/status/1368016304284778503</embed></div><p>In a statement, Levine Cava wrote, &#x201C;We can&#x2019;t afford to let our guard down when we are so close to the finish line. I am confident that by continuing to work together with our residents and businesses, we can drive down our positivity rate below the 5.5% mark needed to minimize community spread of COVID-19.&#x201D;</p><p>The curfew extends from midnight until 6 a.m.</p><p>Hours earlier, 7News cameras captured patients at the <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/new-mass-vaccination-site-at-mdc-north-opens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FEMA vaccination site</a> at Miami-Dade College&#x2019;s North Campus.</p><p>Patients said they waited no longer than an hour to receive their vaccine. They were given the opportunity to choose between the Pfizer vaccine and the single-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.</p><p>&#x201C;I decided to go Johnson &amp; Johnson,&#x201D; said Vian Azzou.</p><p>Levine Cava touted the increase in inoculations countywide.</p><p>&#x201C;The total number of vaccines is maybe approaching 50,000 per week,&#x201D; she said.</p><p>The MDC site currently has the capacity to vaccinate 3,000 people a day.</p><p>Patient Dion Maclin said he also opted for the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.</p><p>&#x201C;There may be some travel plans. Me and my family have been talking about traveling a little bit,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;but we&#x2019;re still going to be cautious until we&#x2019;re all through this.&#x201D;</p><p>In addition to the FEMA sites now up and running, locations like Publix and Winn-Dixie supermarkets are expanding access as well.</p><p>Who can get vaccinated depends on the site itself.</p><p>State sites allow Floridians 65 and older to receive their vaccine, as well as those 18 or older with severe health conditions as long as they bring <a href="http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/covid-physician-form/EO-21-47-Form.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this form</a> filled out and signed by their doctor.</p><p>They also welcome school employees and first responders 50 years of age or older.</p><p>At the federally supported sites, any school employee 18 or older can receive their shot.</p><p>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said access may soon be expanding.</p><p>&#x201C;If the demand is softening, we can then go and get some of the folks who are 60 to 65, and get them in, and then we&#x2019;ll move to 55 and do it,&#x201D; he said.</p><p>On Friday, the Florida Department of Health reported <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/fdoh-reports-over-5900-cases-of-covid-19-on-friday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5,975 new cases</a> of the virus and a positivity rate of 5%. The state&#x2019;s death toll has risen to 31,522.</p><p>Dr. Anthony Fauci said he is worried people are becoming too comfortable and predicts another surge of cases on the horizon.</p><p>&#x201C;Many countries in Europe have seen just that. They had a decrease in cases over a six-week period, they plateaued, and now, over the past week, they saw an increase in cases by 9%,&#x201D; he said.</p><p>For more information about vaccination sites in Florida, click&#xC2;&#xA0;<a href="https://floridahealthcovid19.gov/covid-19-vaccines-in-florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>If you would like to pre-register for a vaccine at the new site, click&#xC2;&#xA0;<a href="https://myvaccine.fl.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>To check for vaccination appointment availability at Publix locations, click&#xC2;&#xA0;<a href="https://www.publix.com/covid-vaccine/florida" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>For more information about vaccinations at Holy Cross Health and a list of the medical conditions that will qualify patients for an appointment, click&#xC2;&#xA0;<a href="https://www.holy-cross.com/covidvaccine?hcmacid=a0Z5G000009JPk3UAG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>If you have a severe underlying health condition that makes you eligible for the vaccine and need a form for your healthcare to sign,&#xC2;&#xA0;<a href="http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/covid-physician-form/EO-21-47-Form.pdf">click here</a>.</p><p>Anyone with questions and concerns about the coronavirus can call the Florida Department of Health&#x2019;s 24-hour hotline at 1-866-779-6121.</p></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several people, including children, had to be transported to the hospital after a partial ceiling collapse at a middle school in Oakland Park.</p>
<p>Oakland Park and Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue crews responded to the scene at Rickards Middle School, Friday morning.</p>
<p>According to the school district, the collapse affected the school&#8217;s media center.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before 10 o&#8217;clock this morning, the principal of Rickards Middle was in his office when he heard a noise, which was followed by a subsequent noise,&#8221; said Keyla Concepcion with Broward County Public Schools. &#8220;When he went out to investigate and see where the noise was coming from, that&#8217;s where he realized that the media center, which is currently under construction, the roof collapsed. Fortunately, no student or faculty members were inside the media center. Everyone has been evacuated to Northeast High School next door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The roof and the joists had collapsed onto the media floor,&#8221; Fort Lauderdale Fire Chief Stephen Krivjanik said. &#8220;There was a major water leak going on in there.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were 184 students and 55 faculty members in the building at the time, but they all made it out safely. There was also a construction crew on the campus at the time of the collapse.</p>
<p>According to fire rescue crews, about a dozen people complained of minor ailments such as headaches, nausea and anxiety and were transported to Holy Cross Hospital and Broward Health Medical Center.</p>
<p>Jeff Olibrice twisted his ankle during the incident.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right, thank God,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was going to use the restroom, and then that&#8217;s when I was just going outside, and then I heard something big. I thought they were just fixing something, but I saw everybody running, and the teacher told me to run so I just ran. Then I twisted my ankle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now there are various minor complaints from two adults and seven children as far as headaches and nausea,&#8221; said Krivjanik.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were crawling under all the debris stuff,&#8221; said Anya, a student at the school. &#8220;It got all in our hair and everything when we got up there. I scraped my knee on the metal piece &#8217;cause everything fell. There was metal everywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was just a loud, &#8216;BOOM&#8217; then all the power went out all the way down the hallway,&#8221; said student Sadel Howard. &#8220;All the lights just shut off all the way down the hallway. It was scary. I&#8217;m glad to be OK. I&#8217;m glad to say I made it out fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They were doing construction in the media center, and I think they were breaking down walls,&#8221; said student Matthew Moron. &#8220;We heard one, &#8216;BOOM&#8217; and like the ceiling was shaking. We heard a second one, the teacher told us to go to the far left of the classroom &#8217;cause the far right was where the media center was. Then the third one, the lights cut out, and then the whole ceiling just fell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My teacher, when she saw teachers and students running out, she just told us, &#8216;Put down everything and run,'&#8221; Howard said.</p>
<p>Krivjanik said they sent dogs inside and used a drone to ensure no one was trapped in the rubble.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luckily, through our search and our primaries and the great attentiveness of the school principal and their staff, they were able to evacuate everybody, get all the construction people out, so everyone was accounted for, but just to be sure, we always do routinely another secondary search, we also brought a dog in to search the entire school to make sure no one was in there and also a drone to check to make sure there was no one on the roof that maybe got hurt during the collapse,&#8221; Krivjanik said.</p>
<p>He said further, &#8220;Once that&#8217;s all been complete, which it has been complete, we can absolutely confirm that there were no injuries inside the school, no one trapped. Everyone got evacuated correctly and is accounted for.&#8221;</p>
<p>7News spoke with some parents who went to pick up their children.</p>
<p>&#8220;My son called me and said that the roof had collapsed at the school, and he was scared, so he said he had to crawl through some hole to get to the roof to be able to leave the school, so I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s going on,&#8221; one parent said. &#8220;I panicked. I left the house right away with no purse, no nothing. I&#8217;m just hoping that everything&#8217;s OK.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cellphone footage showed the roof completely caved in. Concrete, electrical wires, pipes and air conditioning ducts were seen thrown down in a pile on the media center&#8217;s floor.</p>
<p>Students and staff were immediately evacuated to Northeast High School as a precaution.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most important thing is obviously the safety of the students and our faculty, and we&#8217;re just very thankful that none of them were injured, that no one was inside that media center at the time of the incident, and now it&#8217;ll be up to the city and facility personnel to come out and inspect the rest of the structure to determine safety,&#8221; said Concepcion.</p>
<p>Fortunately, e-learning is already in place, so administrators may decide to continue e-learning into next week or until they come up with a plan for students who opted for in-person learning.</p>
<p>The district said they are investigating the cause of the collapse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the race to vaccinate speeds up, a big worry to local leaders are the crowds that come with the spring break season.</p>
<p>Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale are cities where spring breakers usually flock to, and local leaders are urging visitors and residents to be safe.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very worried that there&#8217;s going to be a convergence of people here and a real problem in the aftermath after that,&#8221; said Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber.</p>
<p>&#8220;If everyone follows the rules and stays 6 feet away from each other, wears their masks in the bars, things like that can definitely keep from spreading it,&#8221; said resident Yann Meyjonade.</p>
<p>Last weekend, beaches were crowded, and the crowds are expected to grow this coming weekend.</p>
<p>In Miami Beach, officials are restricting the beaches normal open hours to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and sidewalk cafes will close at midnight. No inflatable devices, tents, tables, loud music or coolers are allowed on the beach.</p>
<p>In Fort Lauderdale, no Lyfts or Ubers are allowed along A1A, which is usually congested during spring break. Barricades have been set up to help keep pedestrians safe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seeing all the gates like that is something I haven&#8217;t seen before,&#8221; said Meyjonade.</p>
<p>No alcohol is allowed on the beach, as well.</p>
<p>Signage has been put up in hotspot areas to remind people to follow the rules that have been in place for almost a year. These include maintaining social distancing and wearing masks.</p>
<p>Some residents said the crowds are significantly smaller in 2021 compared to past years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not near the number of people this year as it was last year,&#8221; said resident Roy Moore.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a little shocked at how packed it was, especially last night for being a Thursday,&#8221; said visitor Paula Coleman. &#8220;Other than that, you know, we&#8217;re just kind of getting our feet wet here today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miami-Dade County has a curfew in effect for spring break that starts at midnight and runs until 6 a.m.</p>
<p>Broward County officials debated implementing a curfew but decided against it. They said, however, if any business or restaurant breaks the rules put in place, they are at risk of being shut down.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two people have died and two others are in the hospital following a rollover crash that forced the closure of all lanes on a major Hollywood roadway.</p>
<p>Though the roadway has reopened, Hollywood Police continue to investigate the pre-dawn Friday morning crash.</p>
<p>It happened along the 3000 block of Hollywood Boulevard, just west of Interstate 95, at around 6 a.m.</p>
<p>Florida Highway Patrol troopers confirmed two people were pronounced dead due to the crash.</p>
<p>Troopers said a vehicle traveling southbound on the I-95 exit ramp to Hollywood Boulevard lost control and collided with a second vehicle at the intersection. A traffic camera in the area captured extensive damage to two vehicles involved in the crash.</p>
<p>The two victims in the second vehicle were transported to the hospital where they remain in critical but stable condition.</p>
<p>Authorities had to shut down both the westbound and eastbound lanes of Hollywood Boulevard at I-95 while they worked the crash scene. They also shut down parts of the I-95 off-ramps to prevent drivers from heading westbound on Hollywood Boulevard.</p>
<p>The roads reopened hours later.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Wilton Manors homeowner is speaking out after a crook apparently disguised as an Amazon delivery driver was caught on surveillance video pretending to drop off an envelope before taking off with a package, but this theft has an unexpected twist.</p>
<p>At first, the homeowner, who asked not to be identified or show his face on camera, thought the impostor&#8217;s actions could have been an error.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought, &#8216;Oh, this is a mistake. Like, he took it by mistake,'&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>However, security footage of the Feb. 22 incident possibly suggests otherwise.</p>
<p>A man seen wearing what appears to be an Amazon vest is seen getting out of a white van and walking to the front door of the home, located near Northeast 20th Street while carrying an envelope.</p>
<p>Moments later, he reaches the front porch, but he does not drop off the envelope. Instead, he is seen walking away with a package that, the homeowner said, had been left by another driver moments earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was actually taking away the packages. He was not delivering anything,&#8221; said the homeowner.</p>
<p>The homeowner said a FedEx driver had dropped off a box. Moments later, the homeowner&#8217;s husband pulled into the home.</p>
<p>&#8220;My husband came home; he sees the package at the front door,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But as he was parking around back, the white van stopped outside the residence.</p>
<p>&#8220;The guy has a package in his hands, then he gets down like he&#8217;s going to deliver it. He looks through our mailbox, takes a package that&#8217;s right there. You&#8217;ll see it&#8217;s a black and white type of package, I guess I would say,&#8221; said the homeowner. &#8220;Then he reaches down to the ground and grabs the package that the FedEx truck just delivered.&#8221;</p>
<p>The homeowner said his husband took notice.</p>
<p>&#8220;My husband comes back around. He sees the package is no longer there,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The homeowner said his husband checked the doorbell camera video, saw what happened and went around to the front of the home to see if the man and his vehicle were still there, and they were.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was able to confront him, &#8216;Hey, you just  took our package. What&#8217;s going on?'&#8221; said the homeowner. &#8220;The guy looked a little dumbfounded that it was really happening.&#8221;</p>
<p>The van driver ended up handing the package over.</p>
<p>Now police are wondering if the man was simply following the FedEx truck, looking for an opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had the little scanner. He looked very legit,&#8221; said the homeowner. &#8220;Even if it&#8217;s a dollar or a cent, you never want your package to get stolen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Inside the box, the homeowner said, was clothing that he had purchased online.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Amazon said the van driver captured on the homeowner&#8217;s doorbell camera does not match the driver who was working in this area at the time of the incident.</p>
<p>If you have any information on this incident or recognize the van driver, call Wilton Manors Police or Broward County Crime Stoppers at 954-493-TIPS. Remember, you can always remain anonymous, and you may be eligible for a $3,000 reward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dozens of people gathered to show their support for a South Florida gym owner who went against Broward County&#8217;s mask mandate order.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police have released surveillance video showing the moments before and after a daytime shooting outside a convenience store in Fort Lauderdale that left a man dead, as they continue their search for the gunman.</p>
<p>Fort Lauderdale Police are reaching out to the public for information in connection with the Feb. 12 incident outside the business, located on Northwest 10th Terrace.</p>
<p>Officials identified the victim as 39-year-old Sheldon Daniels.</p>
<p>Police said the security video captured the shooter moments before and after he opened fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;This video shows a Black male dressed in all black exiting a vehicle, walking around the front of a business in the area,&#8221; said Fort Lauderdale Police spokesperson Casey Liening.</p>
<p>Investigators said the actual shooting happened off camera. The video has no audio, but it shows people running for cover.</p>
<p>Seconds later, police said, the shooter is seen fleeing the scene.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do see him run back toward the vehicle, get in and quickly leave the area,&#8221; said Liening.</p>
<p>Police said the subject remains at large. They said their best chance to locate him might be the surveillance video.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re hoping someone recognizes the way that he walks or the clothes that he&#8217;s wearing,&#8221; said Liening, &#8220;or maybe it&#8217;s someone that frequents the area, and they know who he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you have any information on this shooting, call Fort Lauderdale Police or Broward County Crime Stoppers at 954-493-TIPS. Remember, you can always remain anonymous, and you may be eligible for a $3,000 reward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — A couple driving home from Florida flipped and wrecked their car while swerving to avoid a couch that fell off a truck. And though both escaped serious injury, there was no avoiding a $166 traffic ticket dropped off at the hospital where they were treated.</p>
<p>Jake Singer told the <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/transportation/fl-ne-i-95-couch-accident-citation-20210303-cbgh7lglxfh55nqlhoycgp7hwe-story.html#nt=pf-double%20chain~homepage-top-heads~flex%20feature~curated~home-heads-13~CBGH7LGLXFH55NQLHOYCGP7HWE~1~3~3~13~art%20yes">South Florida SunSentinel</a> that his girlfriend was driving Feb. 20 on Interstate 95 as they returned to Washington, D.C., after a monthlong visit with family in Boca Raton.</p>
<p>Singer said his girlfriend swerved to avoid the couch and that their 2006 Toyota Corolla struck the median and flipped over — and the truck kept going.</p>
<p>The car was totaled and both were taken to the hospital in ambulances, he said, lucky to have survived. But then a Florida Highway Patrol trooper showed up at the hospital to deliver the traffic ticket for “failing to drive in a single lane,” according to the agency&#8217;s crash report.</p>
<p>“He gave us a ticket for basically swerving lanes while trying to avoid a couch that was flying at us on the highway,” Singer told the newspaper.</p>
<p>Singer and his girlfriend were hanging upside down, and passersby helped them out of the vehicle, according to the newspaper report. She asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>A Florida Highway Patrol spokesman, Lt. Yanko Reyes, told the newspaper that while it&#8217;s a tough break for the couple, troopers have discretion when issuing traffic citations. He added that drivers are supposed to maintain control of their vehicles.</p>
<p>“You have to look at the totality of the circumstances,” Reyes said. “Remember, in Florida it is recommended to have at least a two-vehicle length between your vehicle and the vehicles in front of you because that way you have enough time to react in case something like this happens, in case somebody brakes, in case debris falls on the roadway.”</p>
<p>Singer said he attempted to reason with the trooper who brought the citation to the hospital.</p>
<p>“But the starting point is that you’re giving us a safe road to drive on, and that’s the sort of contract we have, and I’m pretty sure couches flying in the air breaks the contract, and we have to do whatever to stay alive,’” he told the newspaper.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two South Florida sisters have teamed up with Her Drive to better their community.</p>
<p>The pair hosted a drive in Pembroke Pines on Wednesday to collect personal hygiene products for those in need.</p>
<p>For three months, the girls have been volunteering with the founders of Her Drive, an organization that provides undergarments and personal care products to women and girls.</p>
<p>With help from their school and their peers who&#8217;ve donated, and through their social media outreach, they&#8217;ve been able to collect dozens of items.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since March, we have Women&#8217;s History Month and then we have the Day of the Woman, we&#8217;re just trying to, you know, get out here, advocate for women,&#8221; Karly Bello said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give back to the community because there&#8217;s a lot of people like, during the pandemic and during these tough times that they don&#8217;t have the resources to be able to go out and buy what they need,&#8221; Keidy Bello said, &#8220;especially like menstrual care is very expensive, so we hope that by having donations and bringing in menstrual care hygiene products that they&#8217;ll be able to, at least, hold out for a couple more days, months, weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls will be having another donation day on March 10 at their school, Somerset Academy Chapel Trail Middle, where they hope to get more products they can donate to two local shelters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A dog&#8217;s love comes in a playful, sweet, often photogenic package.</p>
<p>And often, it’s that love that can smooth the sharp edges of the worst trauma.</p>
<p>Wally and his brother Giovanni are part of the FBI&#8217;s rapid response team, working with victims of crime, calm and quiet, trained to be comforting.</p>
<p>They’re part of a program that the bureau began five years ago.</p>
<p>“These guys know 90 commands, they are trained in 90 commands. In some cases there are judges who have them in their courtroom,” said Dr. Staci Beers of the FBI Office of Victim Assistance.</p>
<p>During the memorial services for two fallen FBI agents last month, Wally, who is based in Washington D.C., was a quiet presence, available for a pat on the head during a family&#8217;s worst time.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s sacredness around the interaction. They&#8217;re just kind of there, and it kind of organically happens,&#8221; Beers said.</p>
<p>Like the time Wally met a victim so traumatized he was not speaking, not reacting.</p>
<p>“I had just been walking by and this person was just standing and literally collapsed on the floor and started crying into Wally&#8217;s coat, and I was not prepared for that, and so, I just literally sat on the floor with this person in silence. There was nothing I could say, nothing I could do but be present with that person in their time of trauma, and the person looked up at me and said, &#8216;Thank you so much,&#8217;” Beers said. “To see it is just magical.”</p>
<p>But like pretty much all dogs, Wally is also a big goof.</p>
<p>Just a kindly face and bundle of golden fur to absorb shock and pain, relieving a human of some of that burden.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A generous South Florida girl set up a bake sale to financially help the owner of a Davie pet store recover from <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/burglars-steal-around-140-birds-from-davie-pet-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent burglary,</a> where over 100 birds were taken.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, 6-year-old Zoe Szura gifted $500 to Charlie Hong, the owner of Birdhouse, along North 68th Avenue and Stirling Road, to help him rebuild from the burglary. Zoe is a bird lover herself and purchased her own bird &#8212; Manu, an 8-year-old African Gray Parrot &#8212; from Hong&#8217;s store in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to help him because he got robbed, and we wanted to help him, so he can feel a little better,&#8221; Zoe said. &#8220;We baked cookies, and we give the money to Charlie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Surveillance video from Feb. 23 captured a person carrying out bird cages &#8212; one in each hand &#8212; from the Davie store. Inside of the store, the power was cut, cages were toppled and a hole was cut in the ceiling, which the burglars climbed through. The stolen birds were different species.</p>
<p>When Zoe found out someone recently stole around 140 birds from Hong, she wanted to help by setting up a bake sale to raise money. She and her mother, Glenda Szura, baked more than 90 cookies to raise money for Hong&#8217;s business.</p>
<p>&#8220;She came up with the idea of baking cookies and fundraising for Charlie,&#8221; Glenda said.</p>
<p>&#8220;She walked in with two boxes of cookies,&#8221; Hong said. &#8220;Her donation really touched my soul, healed me through the last seven days. For the little baby girls who think that much for other people, she felt the pain. For everything, whatever you guys have done for me, I really, really appreciate it from the bottom of my heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>More than $20,000 has been raised for the Birdhouse, and friends are keeping an eye out for people trying to resell the stolen birds.</p>
<p>The missing birds, worth more than $70,000 in total, have not been recovered.</p>
<p>If you have any information on last week&#8217;s burglary, call Broward County Crime Stoppers at 954-493-TIPS. Remember, you can always remain anonymous, and you may be eligible for a $3,000 reward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As access to the COVID-19 vaccine continues to expand, pharmacies in South Florida are set to start offering shots to teachers.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden on Tuesday issued a directive deeming all teachers, school staff and child care workers as essential workers and should be vaccinated.</p>
<p>The State of Florida is currently offering vaccines to teachers 50 years old or older. However, CVS Pharmacy is working with the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program, which follows federal guidelines allowing day care workers, preschool teachers and educators in elementary, middle and high schools to be vaccinated with no age limit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me be clear, we can reopen schools if the right steps are taken even before employees are vaccinated, but time and again, we&#8217;ve heard from educators and parents that have anxieties about that,&#8221; Biden said, &#8220;so as yet another move to help accelerate the safe reopening of schools, let&#8217;s treat in-person learning like an essential service that it is. That means getting essential workers that provide service &#8212; educators, school staff, child care workers &#8212; get them vaccinated immediately. They&#8217;re essential workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine on the way, all teachers are expected to receive shots from CVS Pharmacy. The move comes as officials are trying to reopen all schools and safely protect those who are risking their lives to do their jobs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want every educator, school staff member and child care worker to receive at least one shot by the end of the month of March,&#8221; Biden said. &#8220;To make this happen, starting next week and for the month of March, we&#8217;ll be using our federal pharmacy program to prioritize the vaccination of pre-K through 12 educators and staff and child care workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>With so many students still homeschooled in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, the hope is to get these students back in the classroom.</p>
<p>Broward County Public Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie said on March 5, the district will begin scheduling appointments for the vaccine in a partnership with the Florida Department of Health.</p>
<p>Albert Stellmach, a music teacher at Dr. Henry Perrine Academy of the Arts in Palmetto Bay, stood in line on Wednesday to receive his first dose of the vaccine. He said he has high blood pressure and is obese, so receiving the vaccine is imperative.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting a long time because, right now, I&#8217;m only virtual,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m staying at home, and I&#8217;m one of those teachers that&#8217;s considered critical to stay home. This would change my life and to be able to come into school, and I hate Zooming.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new directive gives teachers and staff the chance to teach without fear of contracting the virus.</p>
<p>&#8220;My thoughts are that it&#8217;s a great thing that President Biden has acknowledged, and I wish it would have been sooner,&#8221; Broward Teachers Union President Ana Fusco said. &#8220;Our educators here in the state of Florida &#8212; and definitely in Broward County &#8212; have been back at campuses since schools opened in August.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This news has hit our schools in a very rapid way,&#8221; United Teachers of Dade President Karla Hernandez-Mats said. &#8220;We&#8217;re seeing slots being filled very quickly, and our teachers are excited that President Biden has provided this opportunity for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The move is also a relief to parents who fear sending their children to a high-risk environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of our schools have hundreds and hundreds of students on campus,&#8221; Fusco said. &#8220;To know that our teachers can be vaccinated, that they&#8217;re going to feel safer, and I know that our parents have a concern that if the teachers are vaccinated, they&#8217;re going to feel safer for their students to be able to come back on campus, so they won&#8217;t possibly bring COVID into their homes to their loved ones.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A South Florida man is under arrest after an FBI raid in Fort Lauderdale.</p>
<p>Paul Miller, 32, was taken into custody during a raid near Southwest 14th Avenue and Sixth Street in Fort Lauderdale, Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>The FBI said they picked him up because he&#8217;s a convicted felon and was in possession of a firearm.</p>
<p>Miller was sent to Broward County Jail Wednesday afternoon after spending the morning in front of a federal judge, who charged him with possessing a firearm.</p>
<p>Neighbors shot cellphone video of Miller being taken away by FBI agents and said they watched as agents left with weapons.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got woken up at about 6 a.m. with loud banging. It sounded like flashbangs. We saw the flashes going out, smoke,&#8221; said neighbor Chase Robinson. &#8220;We started seeing them come outside with boxes. One box definitely looked like either a shotgun on the front or an AK. I couldn&#8217;t really tell from where we were sitting. I heard them talk about 1911s so he definitely had weapons inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miller hadn&#8217;t lived in the area for long. His landlord said he moved down to Fort Lauderdale from New Jersey last month.</p>
<p>&#8220;He moved in on the first of February,&#8221; said the landlord.</p>
<p>Neighbors said he kept to himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw him a few times, like, bringing in groceries and stuff like that, and we would just be like, &#8216;Hey, new neighbor!&#8217; and we wouldn&#8217;t get anything out of him, so we&#8217;re like, &#8216;OK, I guess he doesn&#8217;t want to be social,'&#8221; said Angeline Robinson.</p>
<p>Social media told a different story, where it looks like Miller uses BitChute to spread hate about Jewish people, African Americans and the LGBT community.</p>
<p>A few months ago, he appeared on the cable channel One America News. He&#8217;d been unable to get into a speaking event featuring the founder of the Proud Boys group. He said he was then chased by members of Antifa.</p>
<p>The Anti-Defamation League said they have been tracking Miller for months, as he is known to them and some local officials as a volatile white supremacist.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were concerned, as he grew more and more popular online with his antics through Omegle and other things, that might try to do something to please his followers further somehow,&#8221; said ADL senior investigative researcher Carla Hill.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s too soon to confirm if his online activity is related to his arrest. Those documents are currently sealed.</p>
<p>The feds will likely outline their case at Miller&#8217;s next hearing on Friday morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paul Miller is an extremist, and we consider him dangerous because of what he was doing online and offline, and so, we felt it was important to notify law enforcement of our concerns,&#8221; Hill said.</p>
<p>If Miller is convicted on the weapons charge, he will face 10 years in prison.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There have now been more than 1.91 million reported cases of the coronavirus in Florida, with 31,135 deaths.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Local leaders are expanding access to the COVID-19 vaccine by opening new vaccination sites across South Florida.<p>City of Miami Mayor Francis Suarez and other city leaders visited the vaccination site in Miami&#x2019;s Overtown neighborhood on Tuesday.</p><p>However, organizers at the site said they&#x2019;re not seeing as many people daily as they&#x2019;d like to.</p><p>&#x201C;People being able to see a COVID vaccination site in an African American community is monumental,&#x201D; said Overtown Youth Center CEO Tina Brown.</p><p>No appointment is necessary for those who want to get vaccinated at the Overtown Youth Center located at 450 NW 14th St.</p><p>The site is open seven days a week from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re providing a very precious resource like vaccinations to an area that historically has not had the same amount of resources as other places,&#x201D; said Overtown Youth Center Director Gerardo Castillo.</p><p>&#x201C;For many African Americans who are residing in this community, they feel very comfortable because this site is literally in their backyard,&#x201D; said Brown.</p><p>Organizers of the site said they have the capacity of delivering 200 shots per day, but so far, since opening up last week, they&#x2019;ve administered around 100 shots each day.</p><p>7News cameras captured several people waiting outside of the site, hoping to get vaccinated if not enough seniors or healthcare workers show up.</p><p>&#x201C;If there are vials that are about to expire, obviously, we don&#x2019;t want those to go to waste, so we allow anyone who may be waiting outside to come in and get that vaccine,&#x201D; said Castillo.</p><p>Statewide, <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/desantis-police-firefighters-teachers-ages-50-will-be-eligible-for-covid-19-vaccines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis expanded vaccine access</a> to police officers, firefighters and school personnel ages 50 and above.</p><p>The new order goes into effect on Wednesday.</p><p>National Guard troops arrived at Miami Dade College&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;s North Campus on Tuesday morning, ahead of the vaccination site&#x2019;s opening on Wednesday.</p><p>It will become a federal mass vaccination site capable of administering 2,000 doses of the vaccine a day.</p><p>&#x201C;The cases and hospitalizations for seniors in Florida have plummeted as vaccinations have increased,&#x201D; said DeSantis. &#x201C;Since January 30, the number of seniors hospitalized for COVID has declined by 80% and cases among seniors have declined by 71%. Florida was right to prioritize the elderly. Seniors first works.&#x201D;</p><p>Jackson Health System announced it will offer the vaccine to Florida residents ages 50 and older who are sworn law enforcement officers aged 50 and above, all firefighters aged 50 and above and all K-12 school personnel aged 50 and above.</p><p>Anyone 50 and above with a signed doctor&#x2019;s note on the physician&#x2019;s letterhead or prescription pad with a recommendation that the patient be vaccinated will also be allowed to get their vaccine dose.</p><div><embed type="oembed">https://twitter.com/JacksonHealth/status/1366809534006775814</embed></div><p>For more information about vaccination sites in Florida, click&#xC2;&#xA0;<a href="https://floridahealthcovid19.gov/covid-19-vaccines-in-florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>To check for vaccination appointment availability at Publix locations, click&#xC2;&#xA0;<a href="https://www.publix.com/covid-vaccine/florida" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>For more information about vaccinations at Holy Cross Health and a list of the medical conditions that will qualify patients for an appointment, click&#xC2;&#xA0;<a href="https://www.holy-cross.com/covidvaccine?hcmacid=a0Z5G000009JPk3UAG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Florida Department of Health in Broward County has issued a rabies alert for a portion of Fort Lauderdale, days after a raccoon <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/broward/raccoon-trapped-after-biting-2-women-in-fort-lauderdale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bit two women</a> in the Shady Banks neighborhood.</p>
<p>Officials on Monday said they issued the alert after a raccoon tested positive for rabies. They warned that pets not vaccinated for rabies are at risk of contracting the disease.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a New Yorker, so I have eyes and ears 360 degrees,&#8221; resident Gail Wahn said. &#8220;I also have [my dog], and we can&#8217;t afford to have her be hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rabies alert will remain in effect for 60 days. It encompasses the following boundaries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Southwest Ninth Street to the north</li>
<li>I-95 to the West</li>
<li>South fork of the New River to the east</li>
<li>South fork of the New River to the south</li>
</ul>
<p>Rabies is a disease of the nervous system and is fatal to warm-blooded animals and humans. The only preventive measure for human exposure to rabies is rabies-specific immune globulin and rabies immunization.</p>
<p>Officials said all domestic animals should be vaccinated against rabies, and residents should avoid all contact with wildlife, particularly raccoons, bats, foxes, skunks, otters, bobcats and coyotes.</p>
<p>Residents and visitors are also advised to take the following precautions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep rabies vaccinations up to date for all pets and at-risk livestock.</li>
<li>Do not allow your pets to run free. Follow leash laws by keeping pets and livestock secured on your property.</li>
<li>If your pet or livestock are bitten by a wild animal, seek veterinary assistance for the animal immediately and contact animal control services.</li>
<li>Do not handle, feed or unintentionally attract wild animals with outdoor food sources such as uncovered trash or litter.</li>
<li>Never adopt wild animals or bring them into your home.</li>
<li>Teach children never to handle unfamiliar animals, wild or domestic, even if they appear friendly.</li>
<li>Prevent bats from entering living quarters or occupied spaces in homes, churches, schools and other similar areas, where they might come in contact with people and pets.</li>
</ul>
<p>The raccoon attacks took place Friday morning and prompted Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue crews to contact Florida Fish and Wildlife to try and remove the animal. One woman was landscaping her yard when she was attacked. She said she had &#8220;clippers in her hand&#8221; and hit the raccoon &#8220;very hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a very family-oriented neighborhood,&#8221; neighbor Sheila McKenna said. &#8220;We really enjoy the wild animals, as well. However, just by the nature of things, unfortunately, sometimes one becomes rabid, and they&#8217;re very dangerous. Really we need something that goes out immediately if there is a dangerous animal in the neighborhood. You need instant reaction to take care of the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really unfortunate that that happened to that woman, but I&#8217;m not frightened,&#8221; neighbor Brian Haggerty said. &#8220;It seemed to be an isolated incident. There is rabies in South Florida, so we&#8217;re all aware of that &#8212; just have to keep your eyes open. I don&#8217;t think we have a rampant rabies problem here. I think this was an isolated incident.&#8221;</p>
<p>Officials said anyone who has been bitten or scratched by wild or domestic animals should seek medical attention and report the injury to the Broward FDOH at 954-467-4700.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A driver in Davie lost control and wound up crashing into a canal, and the frightening moment was recorded on video.</p>
<p>The cellphone video, recorded by a witness riding in a car behind the driver, captured the victim&#8217;s black Ford Mustang going out of control along Southwest 136th Avenue at 26th Street, just after 7:45 a.m., Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a regular day. We were just driving, working, and we see the car in front of us swerving all over the road,&#8221; said the witness, Bruno Nafal.</p>
<p>Nafal said he took out his phone and started recording.</p>
<p>&#8220;You never know if he&#8217;s going to hit us, if he&#8217;s going to hit another car,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Nafal said he was making deliveries when he spotted the erratic driver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Super scary, super scary. People were honking at him. Nobody knew what to do,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He was really unsafe.&#8221;</p>
<p>The driver of the Mustang is seen narrowly missing several vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s going to fall in,&#8221; Nafal is heard saying in Spanish.</p>
<p>Moments later, the victim&#8217;s car veered off the road and went into the canal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop, stop, stop the car!&#8221; Nafal is heard saying in Spanish.</p>
<p>Nafal said he and his co-worker pulled over and immediately called 911.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t know what the situation was. The only thing we knew is there was a life in there, and we needed to help out and take care,&#8221; said Nafal.</p>
<p>Nafal said he and his co-worker tried to get the driver out of the car.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me and my co-worker jumped out. We started taking off our clothes, ready to jump in the water, but the engine was still running, the tires were running still,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t know what to do in the situation. We just opened the door, and the water was going in, so we had to close it back up, close the door again and wait for the cops, because we couldn&#8217;t get him out. There was too much water going in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davie Police and Fire Rescue units responded shortly after.</p>
<p>Police said the driver was suffering from a medical episode at the time of the crash.</p>
<p>Nafal said he later learned the victim was suffering from low blood sugar.</p>
<p>The driver was safely taken out of the car. Officials said he was responsive and is expected to be OK.</p>
<p>Nafal said he&#8217;s glad to have been in the right place at the right time. He also has a message for drivers.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t feel safe to drive, please stay at home,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of things going on right now. We don&#8217;t need you on the street being unsafe. Stay at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fortunately, the canal is not deep, because had it been deeper, the outcome could have been much worse.</p>
<p>Police are not releasing the driver&#8217;s name.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A disturbing case of a South Florida doctor accused of child pornography is courting change.</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Mizrachy, a pediatrician from Parkland, has been accused of being a predator after pornographic images of children were found in his home. Now, his case is being handled in federal court.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a state senator is fighting for a law that would make it so that doctors can&#8217;t continue to practice if they&#8217;re arrested for sexual crimes against minors.</p>
<p>After the arrests of both Mizrachy and gastroenterologist Dr. Stewart Bitman, a Florida senator is pushing for a bill that she said will help keep families safe.</p>
<p>Senator Lauren Book wants to be able to suspend an accused doctor&#8217;s license pending the outcome of their investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so what it would be an automatic suspension, not necessarily revocation, until the charges in both the legal proceedings,&#8221; Book said.</p>
<p>Bitman and Mizrachy were both arrested by Broward Sheriff&#8217;s Office deputies back in January.</p>
<p>Book&#8217;s children were once patients under Mizrachy&#8217;s care.</p>
<p>&#8220;Knowing that I handed my children to a predator is completely devastating,&#8221; Book said.</p>
<p>Bitman is accused of sending lewd photos to a 13-year-old girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;He would offer financial reward for photos, and it seems like he cast out a large net,&#8221; said BSO Lt. Andrea Tianga.</p>
<p>Mizrachy is accused of downloading child pornography.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to the photos that were surreptitiously taken of what appeared to be juvenile guests in his house, we also found evidence that we&#8217;re looking into of him chatting online with possibly a teenager, &#8221; Tianga said.</p>
<p>Book is a survivor of sexual abuse herself. If her bill becomes law, doctors like Bitman and Mizrachy will not be able to practice until they prove their innocence.</p>
<p>Mizrachy was fired from West Broward Pediatrics, but he asked the judge to be allowed to practice medicine via teleconference. Book is fighting against that arrangement as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced he will be expanding COVID-19 vaccine access to more members of the community.</p>
<p>Last week, DeSantis mentioned expanding vaccine access to more first responders and teachers, but on Monday morning, the governor said he will be making it official.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be signing an executive order later today to expand vaccine eligibility to all sworn law enforcement officers aged 50 and above, all firefighters aged 50 and above and all K-12 school personnel aged 50 and above,&#8221; he said during a media conference. &#8220;If you look at those numbers, the law enforcement and fire, some of them already got it because we focused on first responders, you&#8217;re talking about 20,000, 25,000 people maybe. Then with the schools, we probably could do all of that 50 up &#8212; K-12 personnel and police/fire with just our J&amp;J shipment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miami-Dade Public Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho discussed how the expansion will benefit local employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re talking about school site employees working at K-12 institutions: teachers, custodians, cafeteria workers, bus drivers, bus aides,&#8221; he said, &#8220;those individuals who have direct contact with our school population, about 8,500 employees.&#8221;</p>
<p>DeSantis&#8217; announcement comes as Publix supermarkets begin administering the vaccine at 136 of their pharmacies across South Florida.</p>
<p>Pedro Lopez, a healthcare worker, received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine at a Publix pharmacy in Miami Shores, Monday morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m definitely happy. I just didn&#8217;t want to get the virus,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Lopez said it took a little persistence to secure an appointment, but the registration process was simple and being able to come to a nearby Publix was convenient.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like it&#8217;s good news for a lot of people,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Luckily, I got in. I was able to register, register for myself, register for my wife &#8212; we&#8217;re healthcare workers &#8212; and I registered for my parents as well, so they should be coming in later on tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>South Florida healthcare workers and seniors now have more options to get the vaccine, including at a Walmart in Lauderdale Lakes.</p>
<p>Lauderdale Lakes Mayor Hazelle Rogers visited the site to get her vaccine.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to get the population out, put vaccines in arms, and that&#8217;s why I wanted to do this publicly, so my community will see that I took my vaccine,&#8221; said Rogers.</p>
<p>Monday night, Holy Cross Health in Fort Lauderdale announced they will be extending vaccine criteria to include people under 65 with certain medical conditions.</p>
<p>The vaccine rollout unfolds one day after the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/us-world/johnson-johnsons-covid-19-vaccine-gets-the-nod-from-cdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got the go-ahead from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> for emergency use for all adults.</p>
<p>It is ready to be shipped out to pharmacies and vaccination sites across the country.</p>
<p>Vaccine doses left a Kentucky UPS facility early Monday morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Supply will be limited for the next couple of weeks following this initial distribution of nearly four million doses,&#8221; said White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Jeff Zients. &#8220;The company then expects to deliver approximately 16 million doses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Experts are making it clear that they recommend all three COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of these vaccines are very safe, and they&#8217;re very effective,&#8221; said Johnson &amp; Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky on CNN.</p>
<p>Unlike the Pfizer and Moderna alternatives, the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine only requires one shot and is easier to store.</p>
<p>&#8220;This means we now have three safe and highly effective vaccines that prevent serious illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19,&#8221; said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky.</p>
<p>As cellphone video of maskless revelers in close proximity continues to surface, Walensky cautioned that it is still too early to return to pre-pandemic routines.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am really worried about reports that more states are rolling back the exact public health measures we have recommended to protect people from COVID-19,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not the time to relax the critical safeguards that we know can stop the spread of COVID-19 in our communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>As of Monday, the U.S. has reported 28,614,504 cases of the virus and 513,393 deaths.</p>
<p>Experts worry that cases and deaths are inching higher.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most recent seven-day average of cases, approximately 67,200, represents an increase of a little over 2% compared to the prior seven days,&#8221; said Walensky. &#8220;Similarly, the most recent seven-day average of deaths has also increased, more than 2% from the previous seven days to nearly 2,000 deaths per day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Starting Wednesday, Miami Dade College&#8217;s North Campus will become a <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/mdc-north-campus-among-4-federal-mass-vaccination-centers-announced-for-florida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal mass vaccination site</a> capable of administering thousands of doses a day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With Spring Break starting amid the pandemic, city officials in Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale are <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/fort-lauderdale-miami-beach-release-rules-and-safety-guidelines-for-spring-break-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">putting rules in place</a> in an effort to control the spread of the virus and avoid large crowds from gathering.</p>
<p>In Miami Beach, the beach will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.</p>
<p>No alcohol, coolers, tents, tables, inflatables or loud music will be allowed.</p>
<p>Miami Beach has also enacted a citywide curfew that starts at midnight.</p>
<p>Tekeysha Mack, who is visiting Miami Beach, urged spring breakers to wear their masks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take care of yourself because we still aren&#8217;t sure, so let&#8217;s just follow the precautions,&#8221; said Mack. &#8220;I am vaccinated. I got the Pfizer [vaccine], but I&#8217;m a realist as well &#8212; we don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m going to keep protecting myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just the way it is right now, you know?&#8221; said Miami Beach visitor Peter Deruvo. &#8220;We all have to put our best foot forward, and I think that having a mask is just one of those things that needs to happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The city will also have a stepped-up police presence during Spring Break.</p>
<p>On Monday morning, 7News cameras captured Miami Beach Police officers patrolling the area.</p>
<p>The new rules didn&#8217;t put a damper on Greg Schenk&#8217;s mood during his visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;The weather is always perfect, the sun is out, the people are friendly,&#8221; said Schenk.</p>
<p>In Fort Lauderdale, no alcohol, tents or canopies will be allowed on the beach.</p>
<p>Signs displaying social distancing and mask-wearing reminders could be seen along A1A.</p>
<p>Uber and Lyft will not be allowed to pick up or drop off riders along State Road A1A, and if they are caught doing so, they will be issued a citation.</p>
<p>The designated parking and drop-off location will be at Las Olas Oceanside Park at 3000 East Las Olas Blvd.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hundreds of cars lined up for a celebratory caravan, as the Tour de Broward held its annual fundraiser and honored supporters who completed a variety of marathons, all for a noble cause.</p>
<p>Organizers of the 12th annual ANF Group Tour de Broward said that putting on Sunday&#8217;s fundraiser in the middle of a pandemic is tricky, especially when it&#8217;s for a hospital.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now we&#8217;re expanding the [Joe DiMaggio] Children&#8217;s Hospital by four stories, growing up with technology for quality and safety and excellent patient care,&#8221; said Caitlin Stella, CEO of Joe DiMaggio Children&#8217;s Hospital, &#8220;but we also have money available for when families need assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even COVID-19 couldn&#8217;t stop fundraising efforts. Organizers said they had to get creative, so they took the show on the road to Miramar Regional Park.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re doing today is we&#8217;re actually having a little drive-thru for the participants who, throughout the month of February, did their own little tour &#8212; the ride, the walk, the run &#8212; on their own, kind of clocked in their mileage on the website and participated by fundraising,&#8221; said Al Fernandez, president of ANF Group.</p>
<p>People took part in big numbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;OK, guys? More than 1,000 participants. We&#8217;ve raised $375,867!&#8221; said Fernandez as he revealed a large check.</p>
<p>Among those who rose to the challenge was Brett Rose, who shared videos of his progress after a bite from a mosquito carrying the West Nile virus impacted his nervous system and his ability to walk during a vacation to the Florida Keys last year.</p>
<p>The virus is rare, affecting about one in every 150 people.</p>
<p>Rose said he wanted to give back to Memorial Healthcare System, so fundraising for the expansion of Joe DiMaggio Children&#8217;s Hospital was the perfect chance.</p>
<p>In six months, Rose has gone from wheelchair to walker to cane. He covered 1,000 meters a day for three days as a way to thank the health care professionals who helped him get back to his family and his life.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have an amazing team of physical and occupational therapists. Full recovery is certainly in the window of happening,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The campaign reached 100% of its fundraising goal this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More South Florida seniors and frontline workers are receiving their shots of protection this weekend.</p>
<p>Hundreds of at-risk residents, volunteers and health care workers were vaccinated Saturday at Chen Senior Medical Center in Northwest Miami-Dade.</p>
<p>The center&#8217;s Broward location is also administering vaccines.</p>
<p>The event was created by the center&#8217;s primary care physicians and the Florida Department of Health in order to protect thousands of seniors in underserved communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been going through a lot, &#8217;cause I do have medical conditions, and just to know I got my vaccine, it means the world to me,&#8221; said patient Monsy Martinez, &#8220;and I&#8217;m very blessed that Chen was able to provide it for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a scheduled boxing match ended vaccinations early at the Hard Rock Stadium. The site closed at 2 p.m. Those with afternoon appointments were notified to reschedule.</p>
<p>Anyone with questions and concerns about the coronavirus can call the Florida Department of Health&#8217;s 24-hour hotline at 1-866-779-6121.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first weekend of spring break 2021 has brought large crowds to South Florida beaches, along with concerns about the potential for a coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Back in the 1960s and 70s, Fort Lauderdale Beach was known as the place where the boys are. On Saturday, it looked like everyone else came down as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just enjoying the weather, getting away from the cold,&#8221; said a beachgoer.</p>
<p>Revelers riding in an SUV cheered and greeted 7News cameras as they drove near Fort Lauderdale Beach.</p>
<p>Spring breakers usually bring stress on cities like Fort Lauderdale and Miami Beach, but this year adds COVID-19 worries to the mix.</p>
<p>Local leaders said they welcome visitors to their beaches, but stressed that they have to play by the rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;We understand there&#8217;s a lot of angst to get out and enjoy our beautiful weather and our beautiful beach, but we&#8217;re just asking for cooperation from our college students that do decide to come to Fort Lauderdale,&#8221; said Fort Lauderdale Police Assistant Interim Cheif Frank Sousa.</p>
<p>No alcohol is allowed on the beach, and no Uber or Lyft drop-offs are permitted along A1A , which was packed Saturday afternoon. Electronic signs are in place to remind beachgoers to keep up their social distancing.</p>
<p>Fort Lauderdale Police officers have stayed visible throughout the weekend.</p>
<p>Local businesses echoed leaders&#8217; calls for patrons to adhere to safety regulations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today we were very busy all day long,&#8221; said Fabio Vaccarella, chef and owner of Casa Del Mare Ristorante along North Fort Lauderdale Beach Boulevard.</p>
<p>Vaccarella said he has been trying to keep up with the crowds and enforcing the rules at his open-air restaurant.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reaction is 80% fine and some people, they don&#8217;t really believe in wearing face masks and don&#8217;t respect sometimes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;We try to do our best to make everybody happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mask wearing has been sporadic at times among spring breakers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hotels, yes. Restaurants, yes, but pretty much, bars and breweries don&#8217;t seem to care, and I feel like they should implement it more,&#8221; said Kyle Heusbourg, who is visiting from Minnesota.</p>
<p>In Miami Beach, city leaders are also hoping to keep things as calm as possible, with the beach open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and sidewalk cafes shutting down at midnight.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;re expecting a larger than typical spring break,&#8221; said Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber.</p>
<p>There is also an increased police presence on South Beach.</p>
<p>Officials in Broward and Miami-Dade counties are urging revelers to party responsibly or risk arrest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I already had COVID, so I&#8217;m not worried about catching it,&#8221; said a Fort Lauderdale Beach reveler.</p>
<p>&#8220;COVID? I think I&#8217;ve had it, I think,&#8221; said another beachgoer. &#8220;Yep, still living.&#8221;</p>
<p>Officials in Broward County debated implementing a curfew during a three-week period but decided against it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Fort Lauderdale officials said they will not hesitate to shut down a business temporarily if it&#8217;s caught violating the rules.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A veteran Broward County educator has been named the district&#8217;s Teacher of the Year.</p>
<p>Monika Moorman is a 23-year veteran teaching first through fifth grades at Central Park Elementary in Plantation.</p>
<p>She was named the district&#8217;s Teacher of the Year during a celebration at the annual Caliber Awards at the Inter Miami CF Stadium in Fort Lauderdale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you to you, Broward educators, for going above and beyond during these trying times,&#8221; Moorman said. &#8220;I am proud and humble to represent you, wherever this journey takes me, and I&#8217;ll make sure to advocate for our needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moorman said she teaches to make the world a better place and added she believes it is a teacher&#8217;s responsibility to challenge students to become inquisitive, assertive and self-aware.</p>
<p>She also said children should be taught to stand out rather than fit in.</p>
