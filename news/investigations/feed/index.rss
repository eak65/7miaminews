										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Right now, most of the attention is placed on the limited supplies of COVID vaccines, but doctors are growing frustrated that a potentially life saving treatment for those infected with the virus is falling off the radar. The Nightteam&#8217;s Kevin Ozebek with tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>When the pandemic hit, 84-year-old Sandi Gordon took every precaution.</p>
<p>Sandi Gordon, COVID survivor: &#8220;I washed my hands until they almost fell off!&#8221;</p>
<p>But despite 10 months of being incredibly careful, Sandi got COVID in December.</p>
<p>Sandi Gordon: &#8220;I thought I was dying to tell you the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandi&#8217;s doctor is Warren Sturman of Broward Health.</p>
<p>He knew she was the perfect candidate for monoclonal antibody therapy.</p>
<p>Dr. Warren Sturman, Broward Health: &#8220;One dose, one hour in the whole treatment.&#8221;</p>
<p>For one hour, synthetic, lab-made COVID-19 antibodies are pumped into the body.</p>
<p>Dr. Warren Sturman: &#8220;I have seen patients look extremely poorly, look like they are on the verge of getting admitted. Then, after that one transfusion, sometimes within an hour, they start to feel better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandi Gordon: &#8220;I felt pretty good right after.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;That quick?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandi Gordon: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t feel like I was dying anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the incredible results, doctors here at Broward Health and at other hospitals offering the treatment say they have hundreds of unused doses, and the doctors are desperate to administer them.</p>
<p>Dr. Aldo Calvo, Broward Health: &#8220;It can really dramatically improve a patient&#8217;s condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;Knowing this treatment is available, what is it like when you see the count come out everyday, and you still see this death toll?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Aldo Calvo: &#8220;It&#8217;s demoralizing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Aldo Calvo says Broward Health has used less than a third of its treatment stockpile given by the federal government.</p>
<p>Dr. Aldo Calvo: &#8220;I think many primary care physicians do not know that we offer monoclonal antibody therapy, and if they did, they would be referring more of their patients.&#8221;</p>
<p>Memorial Hospital Pembroke has even put up a billboard to get the word out about the therapy.</p>
<p>Dr. Mike Estreicher thinks another reason the treatment isn&#8217;t reaching more people is because many get their positive results from mass testing sites.</p>
<p>Dr. Mike Estreicher, Memorial Hospital Pembroke: &#8220;They&#8217;re not necessarily getting tested in conjunction with their primary care physician or at a hospital. When you&#8217;re not doing that, you&#8217;re not connected in a way to find out about all the available treatments.&#8221;</p>
<p>The treatment can prevent high risk people from getting seriously sick or dying from COVID, so if you have tested positive in the past 10 days and are over 65, over 55 with underlying conditions or have diabetes, chronic kidney disease or immuno-suppressive disease, you may qualify for the treatment.</p>
<p>Dr. Aldo Calvo: &#8220;Contact your primary care physician. We can seriously reduce the number of hospitalizations and death if we implement this monoclonal antibody therapy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sandi credits the infusion for being alive today.</p>
<p>Sandi Gordon: &#8220;I felt like something just saved my life. It was that instantaneous.&#8221;</p>
<p>And because the federal government bought and supplies all the doses, this life saving medication did not cost her a penny.</p>
<p>While the actual infusion is free, there are costs to administer the infusion. That will be billed to your health insurance provider.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A South Florida couple was ready to take the huge leap into owning their first home, but instead of moving into a new Florida City development, they had to fight to get their money back. The Nightteam&#8217;s Kevin Ozebek with this special assignment report: Home Heartache.</p>
<p>Yiganys Marrero&#8217;s dream is to own her own home.</p>
<p>Two years ago, when she and her husband toured this model, it was love at first sight.</p>
<p>Yiganys Marrero, shopping for a home: &#8220;It had three bedrooms, two baths. It was all so modern, so clean, stainless steel, so beautiful.</p>
<p>In May 2019, the Marreros finished paying their deposit of $10,245 for the townhouse in Luna at Grand Palms.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a new community in Florida City built by Brickless Developer Group Corp.</p>
<p>Yiganys Marrero: &#8220;Weeks went by, months went by. They told us it would take long because it was pre-construction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Five months later, in August, they received the sales contract, but Yiganys saw changes in the plans she did not like.</p>
<p>Yiganys Marrero: &#8220;I started seeing discrepancies. For example, we paid an additional $5,000 to be a corner unit. We didn&#8217;t get a corner unit. We were placed in the middle of a complex.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Marreros canceled their contract on Aug. 26, 2020 and expected to get their deposit back.</p>
<p>Yiganys Marrero: &#8220;I read the contract. It said 45 to 60 days max.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sixty days passed, and the check did not arrive.</p>
<p>Yiganys called the Brickless office.</p>
<p>Yiganys Marrero: &#8220;She said due to COVID, they&#8217;re taking up to 90 days to do refunds.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, she waited the 90 days before calling the Brickless office again.</p>
<p>This time, she says they told her she would not get her money for another three months.</p>
<p>Yiganys Marrero: &#8220;The last person that was there said to me, &#8216;If you don&#8217;t like my answer, hire an attorney.&#8217; Why should I hire an attorney to get my money?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yiganys didn&#8217;t hire attorney, but others have.</p>
<p>David Blattner, attorney: &#8220;They&#8217;re all very frustrated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fort Lauderdale attorney David Blattner says he represents 20 clients with a variety of complaints against Brickless.</p>
<p>David Blattner: &#8220;One is that they tried to terminate their contracts and were unable to get their deposits back. Two, they had signed reservation agreements as far back as early 2019 and had still not received the final purchase and sale agreement, and three, even if they had received a purchase agreement, the purchase price had been increased since the date that they signed the reservation agreement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right now, Blattner is in negotiations with the company&#8217;s attorneys to resolve his clients&#8217; issues.</p>
<p>David Blattner: &#8220;For almost everyone of them, this is the &#8216;dream house.&#8217; It&#8217;s time they resolve these issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>We contacted Brickless Developer Group Corp. for comment.</p>
<p>The company tells 7News, &#8220;There was an extremely high influx of pre-sale cancellations due to widespread economic uncertainty. While every effort was made to expedite the return of the requested deposits, for a few buyers, it took longer than expected.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the concerns of David Blattner&#8217;s clients, Brickless says, &#8220;We have worked to avoid even a minor price adjustment, but due to the continuing effects of the pandemic &#8230; this has been unavoidable across the entire industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yiganys Marrero: &#8220;We&#8217;re on our way heading to their sales office. We&#8217;re super excited.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two days after 7News contacted Brickless, the Marreros were told to come get their check.</p>
<p>Yiganys Marrero: &#8220;I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart. You&#8217;ve been amazing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that they have their cash, the hunt is back on for their dream home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A collision involving a South Florida police officer has left a woman frustrated after his car crashed into her yard, but it&#8217;s what happened next that left her heartbroken. Karen Hensel has tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>Marilyn Gore, homeowner: &#8220;Papaya, coconuts, more mangoes&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilyn Gore spends a lot of time in her yard because she grows most of her own food.</p>
<p>Marilyn Gore: &#8220;My food comes from my yard.&#8221;</p>
<p>She retired last year as a Miami-Dade public school teacher and spent days at home with her dog Max.</p>
<p>Marilyn Gore: &#8220;I talked to Max like you talk to a person. Max gets his food before I get mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, she says, life changed on the night of Dec. 3.</p>
<p>Marilyn Gore: &#8220;I heard &#8216;plank da plank,&#8217; and I said, &#8216;Oh, God, somebody just crashed into each other.'&#8221;</p>
<p>So she ran outside to help.</p>
<p>Marilyn Gore: &#8220;So when I came out to see if anybody was hurt, I realized my fence was in disarray, and the car was lodged right there and knocked all those pots down, as you can see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Little did she know then that night would bring months of frustration, exhaustion and desperation.</p>
<p>Desperation that would begin weeks later with her beloved Belgian Malinois Max.</p>
<p>Marilyn Gore: &#8220;I cook for him, and it was a little warm, so I said, &#8216;OK, Max, let&#8217;s go wet the plants, and when we come back, we will eat together.'&#8221;</p>
<p>They would never get that chance.</p>
<p>With the fence down, Max ran into the street when he saw another dog and was hit by a car.</p>
<p>Marilyn Gore: &#8220;When I saw him out there and he died&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilyn now says she has trouble sleeping because part of her security fence is still down.</p>
<p>Two months later, Marilyn can&#8217;t escape the memory of that night seeing the mangled fence and the car&#8217;s bumper left behind in her yard.</p>
<p>According to the traffic crash report, an on-duty Miami-Dade Police officer was driving a rental car at the time.</p>
<p>The report says the woman driving the other car &#8220;failed to stop at the red light&#8221; crashing into the officer&#8217;s car and sending it through Marilyn&#8217;s fence.</p>
<p>Marilyn Gore: &#8220;I thought since the police broke it, they would have been the one to take the responsibility and go after the lady, but they leave everything for me to do, and nobody is helping.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilyn says she has made calls every day not only to Miami-Dade Police, but also the other driver&#8217;s insurance adjuster.</p>
<p>Finally, she got a call back that was even more infuriating.</p>
<p>The adjuster told Marilyn to make the claim with her own homeowner&#8217;s insurance.</p>
<p>Marilyn Gore: &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to use my insurance and then my premium goes up, and then, eventually, they drop my homeowner&#8217;s insurance. I can&#8217;t take that risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>So we called the insurance company.</p>
<p>Karen Hensel: &#8220;Hi, This is Karen Hensel with WSVN 7News.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just like for Marilyn, it also repeatedly went to voicemail.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Miami-Dade County investigated and ruled they &#8220;cannot be held liable for this accident and/or damages to your property&#8221; because the other driver &#8220;ran the red light.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilyn Gore: &#8220;Part of the bumper is still there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilyn has sleepless nights because neither side involved in the accident is helping her, and she still has regrets about Max.</p>
<p>Marilyn Gore: &#8220;That day he died, he didn&#8217;t get to eat, and I was so heartbroken.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marilyn says between this fence, at $1,000 to replace, and so many of her plants ruined, a major food source for her, she can&#8217;t even begin to think about replacing Max. A Belgian Malinois can also be thousands of dollars. For now, she just wants to feel safe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researchers at the University of Miami say they may now have the perfect treatment for saving those with the most severe cases of COVID-19. The Nightteam&#8217;s Kevin Ozebek has the details in tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>Jilma Espinoza spent the Fourth of July enjoying the fireworks.</p>
<p>A few days later, she could barely walk.</p>
<p>Jilma Espinoza, stem cell patient: &#8220;I thought it was because of the fumes after the Fourth of July fireworks. I started to feel sick. I started to feel very fatigued.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her daughter Cynthia grew worried as her mother developed more severe symptoms.</p>
<p>Cynthia Lopez, Jilma&#8217;s daughter: &#8220;When we saw she was having a lot of trouble breathing and she couldn&#8217;t get up from bed anymore, we decided to take her to the hospital.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jilma tested positive for COVID-19 and soon had severe pneumonia.</p>
<p>Doctors from the University of Miami Health System tried to treat her, but she deteriorated and was soon intubated.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;Were you terrified at that point?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jilma Espinoza: &#8220;Yes, I was very scared. I thought my life was going to end, and I wasn&#8217;t going to come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cynthia Lopez: &#8220;I was preparing myself for her not to come back, but I prayed every day that she would.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Jilma was in a medically induced coma, doctors asked her daughter if she&#8217;d allow her mother to receive an experimental treatment.</p>
<p>UM was running a trial to see if stem cell therapy could be key in the fight against COVID.</p>
<p>Dr. Camillo Ricordi, UM Miller School of Medicine: &#8220;When COVID exploded, we thought we had the perfect source to treat the lung in the patients most impacted by the most severe cases of COVID-19.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Camillo Ricordi is the director of UM&#8217;s cell transplant center.</p>
<p>He and his colleagues are pioneers in turning stem cells into medicine.</p>
<p>Stem cells have been proven to have a profound effect on the human immune system and can relieve inflammation.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;Why do these cells fight inflammation? How do they do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Camillo Ricordi: &#8220;If they sense inflammation, they start secreting substances that inactivate the inflammatory cycle. They also have properties to promote tissue regeneration and repair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since COVID-19 can trigger the immune system to create inflammation, Dr. Ricordi thought stem cells could fight the effects of COVID, too, so he infused 24 severely sick COVID patients with stem cells harvested from umbilical cords of healthy newborn babies.</p>
<p>More than 80% of the patients recovered in 30 days.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;Potentially, could they have died without this stem cell infusion?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Camillo Ricordi: &#8220;Well, definitely, we know from the control group that over 50%, 58% of the patients in this condition that did not receive the stem cell infusion died.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hola, mommy!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jilma was one the two dozen who received the experimental infusion. This is her shortly after the treatment.</p>
<p>Cynthia Lopez: &#8220;We were very surprised because she got better within a week.&#8221;</p>
<p>Within two weeks, Jilma went from mentally preparing for death to being back in her garden at home.</p>
<p>She still has to do breathing exercises and build back her strength, but Jilma feels better every day.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;If you did not get this treatment, do you think you would be talking to me today?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jilma Espinoza: &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think so because the doctors didn&#8217;t think I had a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Ricardi says the next step is seeing if earlier stem cell infusions can prevent people with COVID from ever developing severe symptoms.</p>
<p>The FDA has only approved stem cell transfusions for COVID patients in critical, life-threatening condition.</p>
<p>More testing needs to be done before it could get full approval.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A South Florida woman was set to inherit several properties after her father&#8217;s death, but she inherited nothing but problems. The Nightteam&#8217;s Kevin Ozebek with tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>This is the Miami duplex where Natasha Johnson spent her childhood.</p>
<p>It badly needs repairs, but she says there&#8217;s nothing she can do.</p>
<p>Natasha Johnson, inherited properties: &#8220;It hurts. It hurts because my dad would never have allowed this.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Natasha&#8217;s father died in 2019, he not only left her this duplex, he also passed on several other properties.</p>
<p>She planned to renovate and rent them out, but instead, she opened the door to a huge headache.</p>
<p>Natasha Johnson: &#8220;They just come in. They break in, and this is their home.&#8221;</p>
<p>She says squatters moved in, not just taking over this unit, but also the one next door.</p>
<p>Natasha Johnson: &#8220;They moved in a refrigerator, a stove. Supposedly, they put some tile down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our cameras spotted people outside another one of the homes her father left her.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;Do you live here?&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman sitting outside would not say if she was paying rent.</p>
<p>Natasha found people living in all five properties she inherited from her father.</p>
<p>None of them are the people who legally rented the homes a few years ago.</p>
<p>Natasha Johnson: &#8220;They&#8217;re turning on the water. They&#8217;re turning on the lights. I&#8217;ve called down there to the water company because they&#8217;re now sending me bills.&#8221;</p>
<p>Natasha&#8217;s father had dementia, so his estate was placed under a court-ordered guardianship before his death.</p>
<p>She thought it would end when he died.</p>
<p>Instead, she says the guardian and attorneys are still arguing over how much each should be paid from the estate.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the houses are racking up code violations.</p>
<p>Natasha Johnson: &#8220;These properties shouldn&#8217;t be in the condition they are. These properties shouldn&#8217;t be behind on taxes as they is. A guardian is supposed to take care of all these things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Natasha is worried the homes could fall into foreclosure before the guardianship is lifted.</p>
<p>If that happens, she&#8217;s afraid there won&#8217;t be anything left to inherit.</p>
<p>Natasha Johnson: &#8220;If they could just release my father&#8217;s assets, then I could be able to go out and do the repairs that need to be done because it costs money to do this.&#8221;</p>
<p>7News called the guardian listed in the court papers.</p>
<p>We wanted to ask why the case is taking so long to get resolved.</p>
<p>We are still waiting for our message to be returned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The coronavirus pandemic has children connecting virtually with each other, but a South Florida father says he was floored by the website he found his young daughter using. 7&#8217;s Karen Hensel has this warning to parents in tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>One blog describes it as the &#8220;Wild West&#8221; of online communication.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called Omegle, a website with the tag line &#8220;Talk to strangers!&#8221;</p>
<p>This father says he caught his 9-year-old daughter doing just that.</p>
<p>Stephen Engasser, father: &#8220;I walked into my daughter&#8217;s room, and she closed the lid on her laptop, and I lifted it up, and she wasn&#8217;t doing her homework. She was chatting with someone, and it was a grown man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stephen Engasser, a U.S. Navy veteran, says he asked his daughter how she ended up on Omegle, which is not a new website, but was new to him.</p>
<p>Stephen Engasser: &#8220;When I asked her, &#8216;How did you find this website? Because I&#8217;ve never heard of it,&#8217; she says, &#8216;Oh, my friend found it on TikTok.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Videos with #Omegle have eight billion &#8212; yes, billion &#8212; views on the popular app TikTok.</p>
<p>Omegle&#8217;s homepage says it&#8217;s a &#8220;great way to meet new friends, even while practicing social distancing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Users are connected randomly and can immediately start video chatting, and although the website says you must be 13 years old and have parental permission to participate, no registration is required.</p>
<p>Stephen Engasser: &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to alert parents out there who have kids. It&#8217;s very dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p>The website itself seems to acknowledge the danger: &#8220;Predators have been known to use Omegle, so please be careful,&#8221; and in small print at the bottom of the page, an even more dire warning: &#8220;Use Omegle at your own peril.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lt. Andrea Tianga, BSO: &#8220;These websites are really becoming a concern for law enforcement, especially a website like Omegle where the premise is to meet with strangers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Broward Sheriff&#8217;s Office Lt. Andrea Tianga is part of the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, a national partnership between local, state and federal law enforcement.</p>
<p>Lt. Andrea Tianga: &#8220;We want to trust our kids. We want to trust our teenagers with their online activity, but I kinda think that&#8217;s like trusting a 1-year-old around a pool.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chatting on Omegle can be anonymous, but Tianga says if children and teens volunteer personal information to strangers, like their social media handles, trouble can follow.</p>
<p>Lt. Andrea Tianga: &#8220;Well, now you&#8217;ve given that bad guy access to your family photos, personal photos of you, and a lot of time, these girls are getting, we call it &#8216;sextorted,&#8217; to get worse and worse and worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>How bad can it get?</p>
<p>Omegle is mentioned in an array of Department of Justice news releases on criminal prosecutions, including a former elementary school music teacher in North Carolina sentenced to 10 years in a child pornography case.</p>
<p>And a South Florida man &#8220;engaged in sextortion sentenced to 139 years in prison.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sextortion&#8221; is blackmailing someone by threatening to post their sexually explicit pictures.</p>
<p>Karen Hensel: &#8220;How do we, as parents, stay ahead of this?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lt. Andrea Tianga: &#8220;You know, I wish I had the magic answer. I wish I could write a book because maybe I&#8217;d be a millionaire. None of us have the answer. I think parents need to check search histories incredibly often.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stephen did just that on his daughter&#8217;s computer and warned her of the dangers.</p>
<p>When he logged on to see what she had been seeing, Stephen says he was shocked and scared.</p>
<p>Stephen Engasser: &#8220;I immediately was connected to people all over the world, but most of them were grown men, and some of these grown men were not wearing clothes, which sickened me.&#8221;</p>
<p>This father has since blocked the website.</p>
<p>7News was unable to reach Omegle for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been three months since a Sunrise man was killed in a case of road rage. Now, with no arrest, his mother is getting frustrated and demanding justice. The Nightteam&#8217;s Kevin Ozebek has more in tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>Chiquita Moore: &#8220;I love you, son, forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chiquita Moore is on a mission. She wants to find the driver who shot and killed her son, Tarrance Geter.</p>
<p>Chiquita Moore, Tarrance&#8217;s mom: &#8220;It&#8217;s painful, you know? I live with this everyday, every second.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her nightmare began in the early morning hours of Oct. 23. Tarrance had just finished work and caught a ride home with a coworker.</p>
<p>Chiquita Moore: &#8220;When I woke up, I looked through the house, and he&#8217;s still not there. I kept calling his phone, texting him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police say during the ride home, Tarrance&#8217;s friend cut off another driver.</p>
<p>That driver, who was in a light colored pickup truck, retaliated with gunfire.</p>
<p>Tarrance&#8217;s friend called 911.</p>
<p>Friend (in 911 call): &#8220;It was a white pickup truck that shot at me!&#8221;</p>
<p>The shots were fired near the intersection of Northwest 44th Street and Nob Hill Road in Sunrise.</p>
<p>At least one bullet blasted through the back window of the vehicle Tarrance&#8217;s friend was driving, which is also a light pickup truck.</p>
<p>Tarrance was found slumped over in the passenger seat.</p>
<p>Friend (in 911 call): &#8220;He got shot. He got shot!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tarrance died the day before he would have turned 21.</p>
<p>Chiquita Moore: &#8220;This child was just beginning his life. He was so excited for his birthday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police have tried for the last three months to learn more about this pickup truck to help them find the shooter.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a new view of it in additional surveillance video just released to 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>Luis Fernandez, Sunrise Police Department: &#8220;We can&#8217;t pinpoint the make and model, the year range at the moment, but we&#8217;re hoping that someone who may have seen someone suspicious that night to please come forward and call us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The evidence is scarce, and Chiquita is angry and frustrated.</p>
<p>Chiquita Moore: &#8220;You said that you see on the camera that the car did a U-turn and followed them seven to eight blocks. You don&#8217;t have a tag? You don&#8217;t have a better description of the car?&#8221;</p>
<p>She also doesn&#8217;t understand why police continue to hold her son&#8217;s personal items as evidence. They gave back his friend&#8217;s vehicle the day after the shooting.</p>
<p>Chiquita Moore: &#8220;They failed me. They failed me from day one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luis Fernandez: &#8220;We want to make sure we preserve as much evidence as we can until there are further developments. Anyone involved in this case is diligently and thoroughly working with the information that we have to provide her peace, justice and closure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunrise Police insist that Tarrance Geter&#8217;s case is not cold, but they do need help. Crime Stoppers is now offering a $3,000 reward for information that will lead to an arrest and a prosecution.</p>
<p>Luis Fernandez: &#8220;There&#8217;s no rest when it comes to something like this. We exhaust all measures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chiquita says there&#8217;s no rest for her either until the killer is caught.</p>
<p>Chiquita Moore: &#8220;I want justice.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The feds have tightened the leash when it comes to animals on board airplanes. One woman trying to fly out of Fort Lauderdale says she was grounded because of the confusion over the new rules. The Nightteam&#8217;s Karen Hensel has tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>A woman tried to bring a peacock on a plane saying it was her emotional support animal.</p>
<p>Woman: &#8220;I&#8217;m not kidding. This woman is wrangling her peacock into the airport.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, there was this furry flyer, Daisy the emotional support squirrel, forced off a flight in Orlando.</p>
<p>Squirrel owner: &#8220;I said you&#8217;re not taking my squirrel, sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emotional support animals from pigs to ducks had been allowed to fly for free, but some passengers took advantage.</p>
<p>Barb Page, investigator, Disability Rights Florida: &#8220;There has been abuse of emotional support animals and service animals, and it has made it increasingly difficult for people who have true service animals.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why the U.S. Department of Transportation cracked down on the free-for-all.</p>
<p>New rules allow airlines to ban emotional support animals, and they make clear &#8220;a service animal is a dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of a person with a disability.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reba Barker (holds up dog): &#8220;This is Nimbus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reba Barker says she depends on her small dog Nimbus.</p>
<p>He is trained to detect when she&#8217;s about to have a panic attack.</p>
<p>Reba Barker, says service dog denied flight: &#8220;He alerts me to let me know that I need to take medicine before I have a full blown attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>In December, she says she had to cancel her JetBlue flight out of Fort Lauderdale after being questioned about the dog.</p>
<p>Reba Barker: &#8220;It&#8217;s on my ticket: service animal and wheelchair. I always do that when I book my flight online. Then, I call the disability section, and they write it in and assign me a seat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reba, who says she suffers from several medical conditions, feels she mistakenly got caught up in the debate over service versus emotional support dogs.</p>
<p>Reba Barker: &#8220;They asked, you know, &#8216;Is that a service dog?&#8217; And I said &#8216;Yeah, he&#8217;s a service dog.&#8217; &#8216;Well, what service does he provide?&#8217; And I said &#8216;Medical alert,&#8217; and he goes, &#8216;What do you mean medical alert? There&#8217;s no such thing as medical alert.&#8217; I said &#8216;What do you mean? It&#8217;s medical alert. He alerts me to a medical condition.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Karen Hensel: &#8220;And you didn&#8217;t want to share your medical information.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reba Barker: &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s none of their business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barb Page: &#8220;Nobody&#8217;s specific diagnosis has to be disclosed ever. The employees at the airport can ask if it&#8217;s a service animal for a person with a disability and what has the dog been trained to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>JetBlue, in a statement to 7 Investigates, said crew members &#8220;engaged the customer asking standard and permitted questions about the specific task the animal was trained to perform. The customer provided conflicting and unclear information.&#8221;</p>
<p>The airline says it gave Reba options, including allowing the dog to fly as an &#8220;in-cabin pet,&#8221; but that costs money.</p>
<p>Reba declined, and the airline refunded her for the flight.</p>
<p>If this happens to you, you do have options before the flight.</p>
<p>Barb Page: &#8220;In a pinch, I would certainly ask for an ADA coordinator, a supervisor from the airline, just trying to resolve something on the spot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reba was able to get a flight on another airline. If you plan to travel with your service dog, the new rules can be confusing, so we have links and more information down below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve seen hackers demand ransom money from governments and businesses. Now, they are targeting individuals like you and me after seizing our social media accounts. The Nightteam&#8217;s Kevin Ozebek with tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>For Seana Mendez, the gym is her office.</p>
<p>Seana Mendez: &#8220;I loved working out with my dad and developed a passion for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a personal trainer at Paradise Gym in Kendall, she has two main marketing tools: her beach body and her Instagram account.</p>
<p>Seana Mendez: &#8220;I need to maintain myself and promote myself to hopefully gain clients who want to train with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>By posting a combination of pics highlighting her physique and the extremely difficult exercises she does to maintain her fitness, Seana has built up a base of nearly 28,000 followers.</p>
<p>Seana Mendez: &#8220;It&#8217;s a really big thing for my business.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, you can only imagine her shock when earlier this month, she suddenly lost access to her account.</p>
<p>Seana Mendez: &#8220;I go into my Instagram and it says password is wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seana then saw this message in her inbox saying, &#8220;The email on your Instagram account was changed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seana Mendez: &#8220;I was just logged out completely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon after she got these messages on WhatsApp: &#8220;Hi seana&#8221; and &#8220;I am the hacker.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seana Mendez: &#8220;I felt like it was a movie. It said, &#8216;Hi Seana, I&#8217;m the hacker&#8217; just like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hacker identified himself as &#8220;ArgeX&#8221; and texted Seana her Instagram password.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;Did your heart sink seeing that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Seana Mendez: &#8220;Yeah, because I know I have that for a lot of other accounts. He even said, &#8216;If I were you, I would change it because I can get into a lot while you&#8217;re sleeping.'&#8221;</p>
<p>The hacker demanded &#8220;$350 in Bitcoin.&#8221; He told Seana if she doesn&#8217;t pay up, &#8220;The account and all data will be deleted permanently.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;Where you ever afraid for your personal safety?&#8221;</p>
<p>Seana Mendez: &#8220;A little bit. I do post where I work. Clearly, he&#8217;s a hacker and can probably figure out where I live easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leeor Geva: &#8220;This is very common. Very, very common.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tech expert Leeor Geva says individual social media accounts are held for ransom more often than you&#8217;d think. Hackers can find username and password information on the deep dark web.</p>
<p>Leeor Geva: &#8220;It&#8217;s more and more common because people use the same password everywhere, and then, criminals, hackers try that password on different services. Once you are hacked, you&#8217;re dealing with a headache.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, there is a solution. You can download what&#8217;s called a &#8220;two-party authentication&#8221; app. I now have one on my phone.</p>
<p>Every 30 seconds, it will generate a new code that&#8217;s needed in addition to a password to log-in to my apps like Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>Leeor Geva: &#8220;It&#8217;s a pain in the butt, but you can reduce your hack-ability to ZERO.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Seana, she endured five days of texts from the hacker but refused to pay him.</p>
<p>Seana Mendez: &#8220;I contemplated it, but I didn&#8217;t want to let this guy win.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luckily for her, she learned a friend of a friend works at Facebook. Since Facebook owns Instagram, that contact was able to get her account back in her hands.</p>
<p>Seana has already downloaded a two-factor authentication app. She&#8217;s advocating for everyone she knows to do the same.</p>
<p>Seana Mendez: &#8220;I think if I would have had that on, this would have been prevented.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, Seana is back to pushing herself at the gym and posting it for her thousands of followers to see.</p>
<p>In your phone&#8217;s app store, you can find a number of free two-factor authentication apps. This includes ones made from both Google and Microsoft.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feathers are flying in one Broward County community in a battle over birds, and it&#8217;s pitting neighbor versus neighbor. 7&#8217;s Karen Hensel investigates.</p>
<p>This is the welcoming committee in the Bristol Isle community in Miramar.</p>
<p>A bunch of birds blocking the road.</p>
<p>Muscovy ducks, Egyptian geese, plus pigeons, egrets, even a wood stork.</p>
<p>The sheer number of birds here has turned neighbor against neighbor.</p>
<p>Sean Chamberlain (in police body camera video): &#8220;All I got is the ducks. They keep trying to take that from me.&#8221;</p>
<p>On one side is Sean Chamberlain, who lives here and cares for his elderly father.</p>
<p>He feeds the birds even though there are signs in the neighborhood reading: &#8220;Please don&#8217;t feed wildlife.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other side, some neighbors who say the feeding has brought more birds and with them, feces and disease.</p>
<p>They say the animals are even ruining their yards.</p>
<p>Neighbor (in police body camera video): &#8220;That is because the ducks walk through that, they don&#8217;t walk through that other side.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is body camera video from Miramar Police and code compliance officers who have been out here dozens of times.</p>
<p>The city is caught in the middle of this duck dispute, one that&#8217;s been ongoing for nearly five years.</p>
<p>Officer (in body camera video): &#8220;They&#8217;re all over on the side here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sean Chamberlain (in body camera video): &#8220;I guess you know we&#8217;re a bird sanctuary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miramar is a bird sanctuary per city code, making it &#8220;unlawful to hunt, wound, molest, injure, or kill any bird,&#8221; even Muscovy ducks, and they cannot be trapped &#8220;except for the preservation of the health and welfare of the public.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neighbors tell police this has become a health hazard.</p>
<p>Neighbor (in body camera video): &#8220;My pool is horrible. I clean feathers every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chamberlain says he&#8217;s not going to stop feeding the ducks.</p>
<p>He and his neighbors have filed complaints against each other.</p>
<p>Code Enforcement officer (in body camera video): &#8220;This has been going on for years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sean Chamberlain (in body camera video): &#8220;Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. This is crazy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Code Enforcement officer (in body camera video): &#8220;Regardless of you have admitting feeding the birds or not, it is causing a problem on the properties.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sean Chamberlain (in body camera video): &#8220;I don&#8217;t agree that I&#8217;ve made that problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>In police reports obtained by 7News, Chamberlain alleged a &#8220;neighbor&#8217;s white Labrador came into his backyard and began to attack ducks&#8221; and that someone sprayed the ducks &#8220;with an unknown substance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another neighbor, the homeowner&#8217;s association president, complained about Chamberlain &#8220;banging on his front door, threatening him.&#8221;</p>
<p>We talked to neighbors who had plenty to say, including that they wouldn&#8217;t mind just a few ducks around, but none would talk on camera.</p>
<p>Sean Chamberlain, feeds the birds: &#8220;I&#8217;m a 280-pound guy who is 6&#8217;2&#8243;. Hey, you know, if I&#8217;m intimidating, I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Chamberlain did agree to speak to us.</p>
<p>Karen Hensel: &#8220;So, what do you say to the neighbors when there are hundreds of ducks who say, &#8216;OK, it&#8217;s too much, enough.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Sean Chamberlain: &#8220;I say drive around the community and don&#8217;t blame me, and they&#8217;re trying to blame me for this situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miramar&#8217;s code compliance has issued Chamberlain and his father six violations, including for feeding the ducks.</p>
<p>They are appealing.</p>
<p>The city declined an interview request citing the pending court case.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the association is not waiting to take action of their own.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re told the board has hired a company to remove the birds.</p>
<p>Sean Chamberlain: &#8220;They can&#8217;t come and trespass on my property, and, you know, hopefully I am going to take some photos.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sean Chamberlain says he will continue to fight this bird battle, and if the animals are trapped, he will file even more complaints with the city asking them to fine the company for every bird taken or killed. We will let you know how this fowl fight ends.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With a post-holiday surge in COVID-19 cases, tracking this pandemic is getting tougher for health officials, but right here in South Florida, scientists are now literally going underground to monitor levels of the virus. 7&#8217;s Kevin Ozebek has more in tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>This is the type of COVID-19 test we are used to seeing, but at Florida Atlantic University, COVID testing is being taken to a whole different level.</p>
<p>Instead of a swab, you need a pole, and instead of taking a sample from someone&#8217;s nose, it&#8217;s taken from the sewer system.</p>
<p>Rakib Ahmed, FAU Master&#8217;s student: &#8220;It is very nasty, but if you&#8217;re wearing the mask, you&#8217;re OK.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the last several months, FAU students have strapped on the PPE and then collected wastewater samples across campus.</p>
<p>Frederick Bloetscher, FAU Engineering professor: &#8220;This, for us, is a pretty easy way to do tracing that doesn&#8217;t really get into people&#8217;s personal space.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you have COVID, the virus sheds in your waste, so with every flush of the toilet, the feces and the virus are pumped into the sewage system, which collects in lift stations.</p>
<p>Frederick Bloetscher: &#8220;Poop doesn&#8217;t lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>COVID can survive up to a week or more in wastewater, so the samples help researchers pinpoint the problem areas.</p>
<p>Frederick Bloetscher: &#8220;If this lift station to my left here comes up positive, then we know it&#8217;s this building that has people that are COVID positive.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the lift stations, the samples are taken to the university lab, where they are put in a centrifuge.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;When you were a kid, did you dream you&#8217;d be centrifuging poo?&#8221;</p>
<p>Alamgir Kabir, FAU PhD student: &#8220;Definitely not, definitely not.&#8221;</p>
<p>They are tested and analyzed, and the students are finding spikes.</p>
<p>Rakib Ahmed: &#8220;The number is a little high for a couple of dormitories.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wastewater testing is also going on in cities across South Florida.</p>
<p>Dr. Jennifer Jurado, Broward County: &#8220;It could give us some insight for the potential increase in cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Jennifer Jurado is the director of Broward County Environmental Planning.</p>
<p>She says the county is partnering with Nova Southeastern University to track COVID in wastewater, and the state is considering using their samples to look for potential mutations.</p>
<p>Dr. Jennifer Jurado: &#8220;We might be able to provide some early insight as to how that might be emerging and be able to pick up on some trends before we&#8217;re actually seeing it realized in a population.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is vital information that helps in the fight against the virus.</p>
<p>Frederick Bloetscher: &#8220;If you&#8217;re a municipality and all of the sudden, we test your lift stations and we start to see it climb, then what you want to do is say, &#8216;Hey, public health people, hospitals, doctor&#8217;s offices, be aware. There is potentially a wave of COVID coming your way, and then, they can plan for that.'&#8221;</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not just COVID. Wastewater testing can also find different strains of flu and other illnesses.</p>
<p>Frederick Bloetscher: &#8220;And I think we&#8217;re only scratching the surface. This is a great opportunity to find something that&#8217;s really helpful, but it&#8217;s certainly not the only application.&#8221;</p>
<p>And for these students, it makes the dirty work worthwhile.</p>
<p>Alamgir Kabir: &#8220;Whatever we are doing, we are doing it for the mankind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;All in the name of science.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alamgir Kabir: &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The tough takedown of a student at a South Florida school has a security guard facing criminal charges. Just one station spoke to that student and his mother. Karen Hensel with tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>Surveillance cameras rolled as a security guard threw a 15-year-old student to the ground at a private school in Pompano Beach.</p>
<p>Student: &#8220;He didn&#8217;t say anything. He just yanked me.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the voice of the teenager, who we are not naming, describing how the incident started last Thursday at the Youth Under Construction School.</p>
<p>Student: &#8220;I came to school not dressed in uniform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not showing up in uniform landed him in &#8220;in-school suspension.&#8221;</p>
<p>The security guard was collecting cell phones in the room.</p>
<p>Student: &#8220;I was taking it out and my headphones dropped, and then my phone fell, and that&#8217;s when he just yanked me out of the chair.&#8221;</p>
<p>You see the guard pull the student out of his seat, shove him across the room and into the principal&#8217;s office. They stand face to face before the guard puts his arms around him and throws him on the floor.</p>
<p>Student: &#8220;He had my jacket squeezing up on my throat where I couldn&#8217;t breathe, and that&#8217;s when he told me, &#8216;Are you trying to resist?&#8217; and I said, &#8216;No, I am just trying to breathe.'&#8221;</p>
<p>The skirmish continues near the couch.</p>
<p>Student: &#8220;I was trying to tell the principal to call my mom, but then he was just sitting there watching. I just wanted to call my mom, and I was scared.&#8221;</p>
<p>He is then brought to the ground a second time.</p>
<p>The video shows the security guard sitting on top of the student.</p>
<p>Meldonise Lane, mother: &#8220;I&#8217;m a mom first, and I was very, very angry.&#8221;</p>
<p>A difficult moment for Meldonise Lane, who arrived a short time later to see her son in handcuffs.<br />
Then, she watched the video.</p>
<p>Meldonise Lane, mother: &#8220;My son is saying he can&#8217;t breathe while another security guard, a teacher, and the principal is sitting over there looking at them.&#8221;</p>
<p>We asked school principal Delvin King, who is seen here sitting at his desk, why he didn&#8217;t intervene.</p>
<p>Delvin King, principal: &#8220;I thought security was restraining him because of some sort of fight or altercation.&#8221;</p>
<p>But King did call police.</p>
<p>Delvin King, principal: &#8220;There was too much excessive force used, and that doesn&#8217;t stand for my policy or what we stand for here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Broward Sheriff&#8217;s deputies responded, and the security guard, 25-year-old Alie Joseph, was arrested.</p>
<p>Joseph is charged with two counts of misdemeanor battery and a third charge of openly carrying a firearm.</p>
<p>We wanted to ask Joseph about what happened.</p>
<p>Karen Hensel: &#8220;I&#8217;m Karen with 7 News. Could we speak to Mr. Joseph?&#8221;</p>
<p>We were told he was not home at the time. But Joseph told a deputy the &#8220;student was disruptive&#8221; and &#8220;did not listen to his verbal commands.&#8221;</p>
<p>And about that gun he was carrying? His arrest report says, &#8220;Joseph is an armed security guard with no license to carry a firearm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meldonise Lane said her son is traumatized.</p>
<p>Meldonise Lane, mother: &#8220;He does not feel safe going back because he said no one stepped in to say anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>The principal, Delvin King, said he terminated the contract with the security company immediately, and that he has asked the Broward Sheriff&#8217;s Office for a school resource officer but is waiting to hear back. Meanwhile, the mom has pulled both of her students from the school.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the COVID pandemic led to a mass shortage of personal protective equipment, two manufacturing companies stepped up to fill the need. 7&#8217;s Kevin Ozebek takes a look at how these essential products are being &#8220;Made in South Florida.&#8221;</p>
<p>An N95 mask is the gold standard of PPE. As the COVID pandemic struck the United States, the demand for them skyrocketed.</p>
<p>Luis Arguello Jr., vice president, DemeTech Corp: &#8220;What we found was that most people couldn&#8217;t access a good mask.&#8221;</p>
<p>Face masks are not the only thing people needed to protect themselves. The rush for sanitizing and antibacterial wipes left store shelves empty for weeks at a time.</p>
<p>7News went inside two Miami-Dade manufacturing companies that are helping to fill the country&#8217;s personal protective equipment shortage.</p>
<p>Luis Arguello Jr.: &#8220;We traditionally made wound care devices, like sutures, hernia mesh and endoscopic devices.&#8221;</p>
<p>DemeTech flipped from making surgical and medical devices, to three-layer face masks and N95s approved by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>Luis Arguello Jr.: &#8220;This is the body of the mask.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;That&#8217;s an N95?&#8221;</p>
<p>Luis Arguello Jr.: &#8220;This is an N95 cup in the first stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>DemeTech&#8217;s Miami Lakes and Doral factories produce millions of masks each day. It&#8217;s an expensive project.</p>
<p>Luis Arguello Jr.: &#8220;The company&#8217;s model right now is not about being profitable, but it&#8217;s about solving a problem that the American culture has, which is our PPE isn&#8217;t made here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Company vice president Luis Arguello Jr. says it may cost only pennies to manufacture masks overseas, but his are FDA approved. Because of the high quality, his biggest customer is the federal government.</p>
<p>Luis Arguello Jr.: &#8220;Ultimately, you get what you pay for. Most importantly with the masks is, they all may look the same, but they&#8217;re not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Inside this DemeTech factory, it&#8217;s hard to find anything imported. The machines, they designed and made themselves. These raw materials come from Tennessee and Georgia. The boxes they use, they&#8217;re made just five miles down the road by another local company.</p>
<p>Raj Prakash, CEO, Anthem United States of Beauty: &#8220;Our products are found in literally every single store that you can walk into in the U.S.&#8221;</p>
<p>Medley-based Anthem United States of Beauty produces cosmetic and skin care wet wipes. When the pandemic hit South Florida, the company received approval to use the materials it already has to make disinfecting wipes.</p>
<p>Raj Prakash: &#8220;Helps kill COVID-19, 99.9%, and that was the number one goal, to continue making more and more disinfecting wipes to keep people safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthem rolls out 50 million disinfecting wipes a day. CEO Raj Prakash says the factory has had to quickly expand in order to meet the growing need.</p>
<p>Raj Prakash: &#8220;Right now, we are keeping up with the demand, as we have added lines, added shifts and continuously hired people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both manufacturing companies say it&#8217;s more expensive to make these products in our backyard than to import from abroad, but they say you&#8217;re paying for strict quality control, research and development, and living wages for these South Florida factory workers.</p>
<p>Luis Arguello Jr.: &#8220;We want to create jobs and want to be able to have people raise up in the economic ladder, and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re trying to do. We&#8217;re trying to build back up the middle class in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>They believe they can make it happen by providing quality PPE that&#8217;s all made in South Florida.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No one likes to think about dying, but many people buy pre-planned funeral packages so their families don&#8217;t have to make these difficult decisions. One South Florida family believed a funeral home would not honor their mother&#8217;s last wishes. 7&#8217;s Kevin Ozebek has more in tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>It was a memorable day for Antolina Martinez. After months of staying home, her family surprised her with a socially distanced party for her 80th birthday.</p>
<p>Mayelin Roman, Antolina Marquez&#8217;s daughter: &#8220;She was ecstatic. She was shocked. She was just so happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the happy day was followed by tragedy. Several weeks later, Antolina caught COVID-19 and died.</p>
<p>Devastated, her family called Bernardo Garcia Funeral Homes, where their mother had purchased a funeral package nine years earlier.</p>
<p>Mory Izquierdo, Antolina Marquez&#8217;s daughter: &#8220;She picked out the coffin. She picked out the flowers. She picked out everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antolina had pre-paid for a full service closed-casket funeral. It included embalming and visitation at the funeral home.</p>
<p>Mayelin Roman: &#8220;At the time, in 2011, she purchased the contract for $3,500.&#8221;</p>
<p>But when the family called Bernardo Garcia Funeral Homes, they say an employee told them they could not provide the services Antolina wanted because she was COVID positive when she died.</p>
<p>Luis Izquierdo, Antolina Marquez&#8217;s grandson: &#8220;There&#8217;s no viewing. There&#8217;s nothing like that. There&#8217;s no embalming. Essentially, what your choices are is, we take the body, and we can bury it, or we can cremate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mory Izquierdo: &#8220;It would have been totally against my mom&#8217;s wishes. That&#8217;s not what she had planned, and that&#8217;s not what she wanted, and that&#8217;s not what she paid with Bernardo Garcia.&#8221;</p>
<p>The family had to hire a new funeral company.</p>
<p>Mayelin Roman: &#8220;It&#8217;s twice the amount, plus a little more.&#8221;</p>
<p>The services that Antolina had paid $3,500 for in 2011 now cost some $8,000.</p>
<p>Luis Izquierdo: &#8220;Our family had to pool and pay out of pocket.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bernardo Garcia Funeral Homes did refund the money Antolina paid. The company, which did not want to comment for this story, does do COVID funerals but could not meet the family&#8217;s wishes.</p>
<p>After we called, one of the funeral home&#8217;s owners contacted Antolina&#8217;s family. They say he told them there must have been a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Mayelin Roman: &#8220;He said that they miscommunicated, that they did not know how to explain it.&#8221;</p>
<p>After our phone call, Bernardo Garcia Funeral Homes sent Antolina&#8217;s family another check. This one covered the additional cost of the service that took place at the other funeral home.</p>
<p>Mayelin Roman: &#8220;They did the right thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now the family says they are finally able to move on.</p>
<p>Bernardo Garcia Funeral Homes also allowed Antolina&#8217;s husband to cancel his pre-paid funeral contract and gave him additional money to buy a new pre-planned funeral elsewhere.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The pandemic has brought a lot of loneliness and heartache. To have a little companionship, some people are shopping for puppies online, but the internet is fertile ground for fraudsters. Karen Hensel has tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>They are cute, lovable, four-legged friends that are helping a lot of people through the isolation of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Lisa Kirby, puppy scam victim: &#8220;I was looking for a second French bulldog online.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lisa Kirby was looking for a new companion, not just for her, but for her dog Phoebe, who had gotten used to her being home.</p>
<p>Lisa Kirby: &#8220;I knew once I had to go back out with business starting up, she was not able to be home alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>But instead of getting a new dog, Lisa fell victim to a pandemic puppy scam.</p>
<p>Lisa Kirby: &#8220;I was frustrated, very disappointed and deflated.&#8221;</p>
<p>It started when Lisa saw Sugarpie on this website listing puppies for sale.</p>
<p>It described Sugarpie as &#8220;gentle, playful, affectionate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lisa fell in love and paid a $1,500 deposit with her credit card.</p>
<p>She was told to meet the seller in this Davie parking lot to pick up her pup.</p>
<p>Turns out the parking lot is in the same strip mall as a pet store, and that&#8217;s when this puppy purchase started to unravel.</p>
<p>Lisa Kirby: &#8220;He swore that he was there. He did not see me. Then, it changed to his wife was in the parking lot looking for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fake seller sent Lisa a picture of a driver&#8217;s license, telling her she should look for this woman named Sherry.</p>
<p>Even texting her this incomplete sentence, &#8220;Have you seen a lady from the ID at the parking?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lisa did not, so she went into the pet store Tea Cups Puppies &amp; Boutique to see if they had any answers.</p>
<p>Denise Bierkle says her business is being used to bait unsuspecting victims.</p>
<p>Denise Bierkle, pet store co-owner: &#8220;They go to pick up their puppies here at our business only to find out that the puppy is not here, and that they&#8217;ve been scammed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lisa Kirby: &#8220;You just lose that family member that you never got to meet.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Lisa is not alone.</p>
<p>Davie Police reports show the same website has lured several others to this parking lot, using what, police say, is a stolen Mississippi driver&#8217;s license.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same ID sent to Lisa.</p>
<p>Denise says the victims include an elderly man who came in with his nurse&#8217;s aide.</p>
<p>Denise Bierkle: &#8220;He was with an assistant because he was not quite able to walk. He had a hard time health-wise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Heartbroken, he left without the chihuahua he thought he was taking home.</p>
<p>Denise Bierkle: &#8220;They take our photos off of our website. They present themselves as us, and then, of course, disappoint many people.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Denise tried to catch the scammer herself, texting &#8220;I am interested in Fiji the French bulldog. What do we do next?&#8221;</p>
<p>After requesting a $900, the scammer sent Denise to the same Davie parking lot where her own store is located!</p>
<p>And, we found some of these pictures on the website are actually taken from other websites, including this one claiming to be the puppy breeders.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s actually a picture of the staff at a vet clinic in South Carolina.</p>
<p>The vet clinic is outraged and told us they have nothing to do with the website.</p>
<p>7 Investigates also tracked down several phone numbers connected to the website.</p>
<p>Karen Hensel (leaving a message): &#8220;Hi, I&#8217;d like to talk to you about some of the puppies that you have for sale.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one returned our calls.</p>
<p>As for Lisa, she ended up finding her second dog.</p>
<p>Lisa Kirby: &#8220;I just love this breed. They&#8217;re not barkers or yippers, but they just make you laugh all the time, as you can tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lisa did get her money back, but only because she used a credit card. Meanwhile, the Davie pet store has this warning at the top of their website: &#8220;Beware of scammers using our photos, logo and address.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gardeners love when their rare trees and shrubs attract endangered birds and butterflies, but a North Miami homeowner says his garden oasis was partially destroyed when a government contractor sprayed chemicals on his property. The Nightteam&#8217;s Kevin Ozebek has tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>Howard Tonkin, landscaper: &#8220;This plant here, it&#8217;s been extinct in Miami-Dade County since 1930.&#8221;</p>
<p>Howard Tonkin loves nothing more than tending his wild garden along the Biscayne River Canal in North Miami.</p>
<p>Howard Tonkin: &#8220;This plant here is called Ambrosia. It&#8217;s an endangered species of beach coastal plants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Howard&#8217;s business is landscaping, using native and endangered greenery, but this fall, some of his rare trees and plants near the canal were killed with an herbicide.</p>
<p>Howard Tonkin: &#8220;If you could have seen what this looked like a month ago, it was just hundreds of butterflies along the waterfront.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of the butterflies are gone, and some of his prized plants now just crumble into dust when touched.</p>
<p>Howard Tonkin: &#8220;The corky stem passion vine is larval host for the Zebra Longwing, our state butterfly, the Julia butterfly, the Gulf Fritillary butterfly. This wild lime tree here was covered in giant swallowtail caterpillars. They&#8217;re all dead. Everything&#8217;s gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The South Florida Water Management District sprays along these banks to stop plant growth that can clog the canals and cause flooding. As soon as Howard saw his chemically burned foliage, he suspected the government agency was to blame.</p>
<p>Howard Tonkin: &#8220;The fact that they keep spraying these defoliant chemicals as a way of controlling foliage on the waterfront, it&#8217;s just not acceptable.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Howard&#8217;s suspicions were right.</p>
<p>After weeks of pushing for answers, the South Florida Water Management District told 7 Investigates one of its contractors mistakenly treated Howard&#8217;s yard.</p>
<p>Howard Tonkin: &#8220;She apologized and said she wanted to replace my plants, and that she wanted to give me some type of sign for not spraying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Canal spraying has also been an issue in other neighborhoods. In 2019, El Portal residents were <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/investigations/el-portal-homeowners-concerned-about-herbicide-being-sprayed-along-canal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unhappy the district</a> sprayed an herbicide containing glyphosate. Some fear it causes cancer.</p>
<p>Kristen McLean, concerned homeowner: &#8220;I don&#8217;t want it in the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>South Florida Water Management District says it sprayed an herbicide called triclopyr on Howard&#8217;s yard. He&#8217;s hoping their mistake will lead to more careful treatment of the vegetation on South Florida canals.</p>
<p>Howard Tonkin: &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a really wonderful thing that Channel 7 has brought attention to this issue, and perhaps, this is a starting point where we can begin a conversation with SFWM about how we can all work better together to improve the quality of life for everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>But before that conversation gets started, Howard is relieved his yard and his plant will never be sprayed again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve said goodbye to 2020, the year, of course, that brought with it a global pandemic. As the year unfolded, the 7 Investigates team was on the front line of the health crisis every step of the way. The Nightteam&#8217;s Kevin Ozebek looks back.</p>
<p>As South Florida&#8217;s healthcare heroes suited up, so did the 7 Investigates team.</p>
<p>We were the first journalists to go inside the <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/front-line-workers-patients-in-jackson-memorial-hospitals-covid-19-unit-share-warning-with-public/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID units</a> at Jackson Memorial Hospital.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;Raise your hand if this has been the most trying, difficult year of your career?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nurses: &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chris Polanco, JMH COVID Nurse: &#8220;I&#8217;ll never forget having patients look me in the eye and ask me if I am going to die. &#8216;Is today the day I am going to die?&#8217; When you&#8217;re in the epicenter and you&#8217;re holding someone&#8217;s mom&#8217;s hands, and she&#8217;s asking you, &#8216;Is this the day?&#8217; And sometimes, it was their day.&#8221;</p>
<p>7 Investigates also gave you an exclusive look inside <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/investigations/front-line-fighters-an-inside-look-at-broward-healths-covid-19-unit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Broward Health Medical Center</a>.</p>
<p>We met nurse Sara Freeman and Dr. Sunil Kumar during the height of the summer surge.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;Can you describe what it is like right now inside your ICU?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Sunil Kumar, Broward Health Medical Center: &#8220;It is scary.&#8221;</p>
<p>We followed them <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/investigations/front-line-workers-at-broward-healths-covid-19-unit-making-strides-in-treating-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through the winter surge</a> as vaccine approval was in sight.</p>
<p>Nurse Sara Freeman: &#8220;There does seem to be light at the end of the tunnel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frontline healthcare workers are now being inoculated across the country, and they can thank South Floridians like Erica Rodriguez.</p>
<p>Erica Rodriguez, took part in vaccine trial: &#8220;I was nervous. I was like, &#8216;Well, what if there are side effects?'&#8221;</p>
<p>We introduced you to Rodriguez as she took part in the Pfizer <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/investigations/search-for-protection-south-floridians-take-part-in-modernas-covid-19-vaccine-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccine trial</a>.</p>
<p>We also got access to this Hollywood lab where the Moderna vaccine was tested.</p>
<p>David Kent, took part in vaccine trial: &#8220;One small shot for me, one big shot for mankind.&#8221;</p>
<p>We highlighted the incredible work of Drs. Michael Farzan and Hyeryun Choe.</p>
<p>Inside their labs at the <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/investigations/covid-mutation-researchers-in-jupiter-say-virus-is-becoming-more-infectious/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scripps Research campus</a> in Jupiter, he developed his own vaccine. She studied how the virus mutated to become more infectious.</p>
<p>Dr. Hyeryun Choe, Scripps Research: &#8220;I work until midnight, 1 a.m.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Farzan: &#8220;I want to help people. I wish I could stop all infectious diseases.&#8221;</p>
<p>While we spoke to the brightest minds fighting the pandemic, we also exposed the failure to contain the spread.</p>
<p>We dug into the state&#8217;s <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/investigations/2-south-florida-mayors-criticize-states-contact-tracing-program-as-former-tracer-speaks-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact tracing program</a> after we learned during the July surge, contact tracers weren&#8217;t even close to reaching half of those infected.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;If there was a better contact tracing program in this county during the height of the pandemic, would we be in better shape economically&#8221;</p>
<p>Mayor Francis Suarez, Miami: &#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt. No doubt about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mayor Dan Gelber, Miami Beach: &#8220;When we screw this up, people die. That&#8217;s the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>We heard from whistleblower Adrienne Barker, who worked as a contact tracer in Central Florida.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;In your four weeks on the job, did you ever make one phone call to someone who is COVID-19 positive?&#8221;</p>
<p>Adrienne Barker: &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;Not one&#8221;</p>
<p>Adrienne Barker: &#8220;Not one.&#8221;</p>
<p>We also investigated how to keep you safe throughout the pandemic.</p>
<p>At Florida Atlantic University, Dr. Nwadiuta Esiobu <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/investigations/mask-test-fau-microbiologist-checks-face-coverings-for-protection-against-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed us</a> with a cough test that most masks are very effective at blocking COVID spreading droplets.</p>
<p>Dr. Nwadiuta Esiobu, FAU: &#8220;Let&#8217;s keep the politics out of this, and whenever it is necessary, wear the mask.&#8221;</p>
<p>And her colleague, Dr. Patrick Grant, ran experiments showing how if we don&#8217;t change out our masks daily, they can become breeding grounds for potentially bad bacteria and fungi.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;Oh, gross!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Patrick Grant, FAU: &#8220;I was pretty disturbed to see how much was growing on this.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2021, 7News will continue to investigate as, hopefully, this global health crisis will finally come to an end.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2020 was a year like no other, and it kept our 7Investigates team busy. From stories on the pandemic to a rare look inside South Florida jails and even a change to state law, investigative reporter Karen Hensel has a look back at what the team uncovered.</p>
<p>In January, 7News was the first in the country to <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/video-shows-confessed-msd-shooter-attacking-bso-deputy-behind-bars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">obtain video</a> of the confessed Parkland shooter behind bars.</p>
<p>The recording starts with Nikolas Cruz walking in slow circles inside the Broward Main Jail before giving a Broward Sheriff&#8217;s Office deputy the middle finger, charging and punching him and even grabbing the deputy&#8217;s Taser.</p>
<p>In another look inside a Broward jail, 7Investigates obtained video of a detention deputy <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/investigations/jail-video-shows-detention-deputy-repeatedly-punching-female-inmate-bso-review-finds-no-misconduct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">punching an inmate 13 times</a> before throwing her on the floor.</p>
<p>Chet Epperson, former police chief: &#8220;That&#8217;s a very concerning video.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his report, the deputy wrote the inmate &#8220;spit in my face, eyes and mouth &#8230; gouged something into my right eye&#8221; and said he was &#8220;in fear of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>A BSO review identified no misconduct by the deputy.</p>
<p>7News also investigated old police cars being sold to civilians.</p>
<p><a href="https://wsvn.com/news/investigations/theyre-not-police-cars-but-they-used-to-be-retired-law-enforcement-vehicles-can-create-confusion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our 2019 story</a> led lawmakers to <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/investigations/florida-lawmakers-unanimously-pass-bill-requiring-removal-of-official-markings-before-retired-police-cars-are-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">act in 2020</a> after we revealed Florida Law did not say who was responsible for removing official markings.</p>
<p>Some retired cars still on the road <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/investigations/state-lawmakers-look-to-close-loophole-by-requiring-markings-be-removed-from-retired-police-cars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had slipped through the cracks</a>.</p>
<p>State Sen. Annette Taddeo: &#8220;It was a loophole in the law, and we have fixed that loophole.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, law enforcement agencies and auction companies must provide proof police markings have been removed before selling old cop cars.</p>
<p>Of course, the coronavirus crisis impacted everyone in some way this year.</p>
<p>Florida Atlantic University researchers demonstrated how some <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/special-reports/fau-researchers-show-how-far-respiratory-droplets-from-a-cough-can-spread-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">respiratory droplets</a> from a heavy cough could reach up to 12 feet and how masks help slow the spread.</p>
<p>State employee: &#8220;The people here in Florida deserve better.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a 7News exclusive, a state employee <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/state-employee-speaks-out-about-whats-behind-delays-in-floridas-unemployment-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stepped forward anonymously</a> describing what he called a systematic failure processing unemployment applications that were mailed in.</p>
<p>State employee: &#8220;Every day, I&#8217;m seeing applications that are a month old, three weeks old.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there were pandemic parties from <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/investigations/neighbors-fed-up-with-parties-during-pandemic-at-ne-miami-dade-mansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miami mansions</a> packed with people to <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/investigations/residents-at-2-miami-condos-fed-up-with-short-term-rentals-pandemic-parties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">condo chaos</a>.</p>
<p>Rita Lagace: &#8220;Hundreds, hundreds! No one has a mask on. It is like a joke!&#8221;</p>
<p>With bars and clubs closed due to COVID-19, the parties moved underground turning luxury living into a nightmare for some residents.</p>
<p>Resident: &#8220;You kind of feel like you&#8217;re a prisoner in your own building. It&#8217;s kind of insane.&#8221;</p>
<p>7Investigates also <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/county-launches-investigation-after-7news-documents-black-smoke-billowing-from-miami-funeral-homes-crematory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented black smoke billowing</a> out of three human crematories in South Florida.</p>
<p>Reporter Karen Hensel, on the phone: &#8220;Hi, this is Karen Hensel with 7News, could I talk to someone about the black smoke that is coming out of your chimney right now?&#8221;</p>
<p>One concern was the <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/special-reports/could-some-body-bags-burned-during-covid-pandemic-pose-a-health-risk-state-set-to-notify-human-crematories-of-the-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">burning of thicker body bags</a> during the pandemic, potentially containing higher levels of a hazardous chemical.</p>
<p>Steven Bedoya: &#8220;So the bags they normally use are a bit thinner, but these thicker bags are pretty much what&#8217;s being used now to wrap the bodies, so it&#8217;s something new that we&#8217;re encountering with the pandemic.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you think there&#8217;s something we should investigate, here&#8217;s how to reach us in 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From real estate rip-offs to allegations of sexual harassment in a Broward workplace, 7 Investigates spent the year digging into the problems facing South Florida. 7&#8217;s Kevin Ozebek looks back at what he and the team uncovered in 2020.</p>
<p>In 2020, the pandemic did not stop us from chasing down answers.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;Chris, can we please talk to you about these text messages you sent?&#8221;</p>
<p>7 Investigates exposed allegations of sexual harassment against Pembroke Park Supervisor Chris McKine, who was accused of sending pornographic images to an employee on his town-issued cellphone.</p>
<p>Chris McKine: &#8220;Yes, I regretted everything I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>After our story, the case against him was settled, and McKine lost his job.</p>
<p>We saw how Tim Ahlborg of Lauderhill endured homophobic slurs.</p>
<p>Richard Ross, neighbor: &#8220;[Expletive] Timothy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim Ahlborg: &#8220;Thank you, Richard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Richard Ross: &#8220;You&#8217;re welcome, [expletive].&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim Ahlborg: &#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>From a neighbor who lived in his condo complex.</p>
<p>Tim Ahlborg: &#8220;I&#8217;m actually taping you now.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Tim was even more disturbed when he called police, and the officer would not file a report.</p>
<p>Tim Ahlborg: &#8220;I was very angry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lauderhill Police did eventually file that report after 7 Investigates starting asking questions.</p>
<p>This year, we met Jennifer Willis.</p>
<p>Jennifer Willis: &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t breathe. I was &#8212; I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>She fell for a work-from-home scam after getting furloughed during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Jennifer received two checks and was told to cash them and send the money to certified office supply vendors.</p>
<p>Jennifer Willis: &#8220;The money cleared, so I didn&#8217;t think anything was wrong with that.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the checks and the vendors were fake, and Jennifer was on the hook for $9,000.</p>
<p>While she has not gotten a single penny back, on the bright side, Jennifer tells us, she has restarted one of her two part-time jobs but admits it will take a long time to pay back the money.</p>
<p>We also looked into the double disaster in the Bahamas, struggling from both COVID-19 and the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian.</p>
<p>Ed Stroebel, Hope 4 Hope Town: &#8220;Imagine going through this whole pandemic without running water to wash your hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>We investigated a second public health crisis unfolding in Key Largo.</p>
<p>Jennifer Jones, dengue fever survivor: &#8220;It literally feels like your eyeballs are trying to be ripped from your head.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dozens of people were getting seriously sick because of a dengue fever outbreak.</p>
<p>Leonardo Bello, dengue fever survivor: &#8220;I just got to the point where I could barely walk. Your feet start peeling, like skin falling off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ernie Young reached out to 7 Investigates after he learned his new landlord wasn&#8217;t who she claimed to be.</p>
<p>Ernie Young: &#8220;This is an Airbnb that she had rented and was selling on the internet as her own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fort Lauderdale Police say Britnee Theiss conned Ernie. She disappeared, until Detective Jesse Gossman spotted her during spring break.</p>
<p>He identified Britnee by pulling up our report on his phone.</p>
<p>Detective Jesse Gossman, Fort Lauderdale Police: &#8220;She&#8217;s the one that was on the news, for the Airbnb thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>And we pushed for answers after a dream trip turned into a nightmare.</p>
<p>Batuka Williams, Hadley Park senior: &#8221;I need that money, especially right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Members of a seniors group at Charles Hadley Park paid around $2,000 each for an Alaskan cruise in 2018. Months later, park director and City of Miami employee Antavius Howell told them the trip was cancelled.</p>
<p>Charlean Cobb, Hadley Park senior: &#8220;We were all heartbroken, but he said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8217; we will get our money, we will be refunded our money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Howell unexpectedly died this year without returning all of the money. A city spokeswoman tells us she cannot comment until Miami Police finish an investigation.</p>
<p>Charlean Cobb, Hadley Park senior: &#8220;Shame on you! Two to three thousand dollars. That&#8217;s a lot of money for no one to say anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>That police investigation continues, but after seeing our story, a local company is now stepping in to get those seniors some extra cash for Christmas. We&#8217;ll bring you the holiday update to that 7 Investigates on Christmas night at 10 p.m., right here on 7.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It started with an unusual traffic stop involving a South Florida deputy and two federal agents. Now, a three-year saga stretching from the Florida Keys to federal court has a conclusion. 7&#8217;s Karen Hensel investigates.</p>
<p>After Hurricane Irma tore through the Keys in September 2017, Monroe County Sheriff&#8217;s Sgt. Mark Jones <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/investigations/south-florida-sheriffs-deputy-says-2-atf-agents-assaulted-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was on patrol in his unmarked department truck</a>.</p>
<p>Sgt. Mark Jones, Monroe County Sheriff&#8217;s Office, October 2019: &#8220;I was working days and nights. I mean, we didn&#8217;t get much sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jones had just finished helping remove debris on Sugarloaf Key when he saw an SUV blocking the road.</p>
<p>Mark Jones: &#8220;I&#8217;m like, &#8216;I wonder if they know we&#8217;re back here,&#8217; so I honked my horn.&#8221;</p>
<p>Turns out the sergeant was honking at two ATF agents.</p>
<p>What happened next set off a chain of events pitting law enforcement against law enforcement.</p>
<p>Mark Jones: &#8220;To see what just happened to me has changed me forever. OK, I see what good is, and I have seen what evil looks like behind a badge.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the year since that first interview, Jones, who has since been promoted to lieutenant, tells me he still thinks about that day.</p>
<p>Lt. Mark Jones: &#8220;My thoughts on that is: I hope no one ever has to experience that.&#8221;</p>
<p>As 7News first reported in 2019, Jones pulled around the agents&#8217; SUV and was quickly pulled over.</p>
<p>Mark Jones: &#8220;I said, &#8216;Sheriff&#8217;s Office, why are you stopping me?&#8217; They get out of their vehicle, and they are on a beeline for me. I mean, they&#8217;re coming at me, and I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Sheriff&#8217;s Office.&#8217; I keep yelling &#8216;Sheriff&#8217;s Office, why are you stopping me?'&#8221;</p>
<p>The ATF agents were in the Keys assisting with public safety patrols after the hurricane.</p>
<p>Mark Jones: &#8220;The guy put his gun within inches of my face, cussing, using profanity the entire time. They threw me over the hood. They put my arm behind my back and took my wrist up to the back of my neck. I knew the second they injured me.&#8221;</p>
<p>A neighbor recorded this video of the three men, but things had already calmed down.</p>
<p>The agents let Jones go, but he ended up with a torn rotator cuff and needed surgery for his shoulder.</p>
<p>Mark Jones: &#8220;They were on a mission. Their mission was &#8216;Teach this guy a lesson for honking his horn. We&#8217;re federal agents. How dare you?&#8217; I went from being able to help people to being beat up by other law enforcement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jones sued the federal government and ATF agents Luis Arias and Jason Wilson.</p>
<p>The case has now settled with taxpayers ultimately paying out more than $200,000.</p>
<p>Mark Jones: &#8220;I was not pursuing the monetary part until after I realized that there was no disciplinary action leaning towards the two agents.&#8221;</p>
<p>ATF declined to comment on the case or settlement, but 7News obtained a copy of the agency&#8217;s internal report into the 2017 incident. Not only does it clear the special agents of wrongdoing, it calls into question the action and behavior of Mark Jones that day.</p>
<p>Special Agent Arias told investigators he yelled &#8220;Let me see your (expletive) hands&#8221; several times after pulling Jones over for speeding and driving too close to utility workers.</p>
<p>He said Jones &#8212; who was not in uniform at the time &#8212; did not comply with commands.</p>
<p>Instead, yelling, &#8220;Do you know who the (expletive) I am? I am a deputy sheriff in this county.&#8221;</p>
<p>The investigator concluded &#8220;the physical force used by [Special Agent] Arias was appropriate and consistent with current ATF policy and training.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jones&#8217; attorney, Stuart Kaplan, who is a former FBI agent, does not agree.</p>
<p>Stuart Kaplan, attorney: &#8220;By virtue of the fact that the United States government through the Treasury Department had to come out of pocket with six figures, I think that speaks volumes for holding these two agents accountable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lt. Jones is ready to move on.</p>
<p>Mark Jones: &#8220;It feels like a 1,000 pounds have been lifted off of my chest.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two women in their 70s packing a punch, volunteering to protect their fellow seniors from scammers this holiday season. Here&#8217;s Karen Hensel with tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>These silver-haired sleuths don&#8217;t carry a badge or a gun, but they do pack something else: experience.</p>
<p>Jeanne Dillon, &#8220;Senior Sleuth&#8221; volunteer: &#8220;I&#8217;ll be 75 shortly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joyce King, &#8220;Senior Sleuth&#8221; volunteer: &#8220;I have to remember &#8212; 79.&#8221;</p>
<p>Karen Hensel: &#8220;You&#8217;re 79?&#8221;</p>
<p>Joyce King: &#8220;I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne Dillon is a retired Miami Police detective.</p>
<p>Jeanne Dillon (on the phone): &#8220;Good morning, Seniors vs. Crime&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Joyce King is a retired payroll supervisor.</p>
<p>The pair is among hundreds of volunteers across the state part of a project with the Florida Attorney General&#8217;s Office.</p>
<p>The seniors&#8217; mission: standing guard against fraud.</p>
<p>Jeanne Dillon: &#8220;Checking addresses, checking backgrounds, checking if they are licensed, so there are a lot of things that relate back to just being a detective and investigating.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marty Jacobson oversees the Seniors vs. Crime offices in South Florida.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also retired law enforcement.</p>
<p>Marty Jacobson, Deputy Regional Director: &#8220;We have retired police officers, accountants, executives from Fortune 500 companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeanne Dillon (on the phone): &#8220;Any papers that you have, any contracts that you&#8217;ve signed&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Volunteers spend hours working the phones to find solutions for seniors who have been scammed.</p>
<p>By the time seniors call in here, many are frustrated and desperate for help.</p>
<p>Joyce King: &#8220;Very disappointed and angry people. No one is calling them. No one is doing anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>A common tactic fraudsters use to lure seniors: loneliness.</p>
<p>Jeanne Dillon: &#8220;Someone calls them on the phone, and they want someone to talk to, and before they know it, they&#8217;ve been fooled.&#8221;</p>
<p>So these ladies, flip the script, working to get back what scammers have taken.</p>
<p>Last year alone, the state&#8217;s &#8220;Senior Sleuths&#8221; worked 1,900 cases of reported fraud, resulting $1.7 million in recoveries.</p>
<p>Joyce King: &#8220;It is so good to make that phone call. We finally, finally have gotten you some money.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are times the seniors are even sent in undercover.</p>
<p>Marty Jacobson: &#8220;It would be similar to taking grandma or granny from the Beverly Hillbillies and placing her undercover. She&#8217;s not packing a gun, but she&#8217;s got an attitude.&#8221;</p>
<p>An important crime-fighting weapon when you consider the Federal Trade Commission lists Florida at number 2 in the country for fraud and identity theft complaints, so this holiday season, be on alert.</p>
<p>When it comes to deliveries, beware of bogus texts or emails asking you to click a link to update shipping preferences.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one way thieves try to steal personal information, and with more people shopping online due to the pandemic, keep an eye out for fake websites that may look legit.</p>
<p>And speaking of the pandemic,  watch out for COVID cons.</p>
<p>The Florida Attorney General says, &#8220;Never send money or financial information to anyone offering a COVID-19 vaccine or claiming the ability to expedite the process.&#8221;</p>
<p>We all know 2020 has been a rough year, so don&#8217;t let scammers make it any worse. We have links filled with tips on how not to get scammed down below, and as for those &#8220;Senior Sleuths,&#8221; the program is free for seniors in Florida, and you can bet the volunteers will be working the phones well into 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The run is over for a former South Florida man who believed he was above the law. He&#8217;s now facing decades behind bars. 7&#8217;s Karen Hensel investigates.</p>
<p>It was 2015 when 7News viewers were introduced to Anthony Williams. That&#8217;s when longtime investigative reporter Carmel Cafiero first met with Williams at this Cooper City home.</p>
<p>Williams wanted to talk to Carmel about her story on sovereign citizens, people who falsely believe they&#8217;re immune to laws, like paying taxes or having a driver&#8217;s license.</p>
<p>Carmel Cafiero: &#8220;Do you have a driver&#8217;s license?&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony Williams: &#8220;No, I do not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carmel Cafiero: &#8220;Have you been ticketed?&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony Williams: &#8220;Yes, I have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Williams said he was not a sovereign citizen, he carried a &#8220;Special Police&#8221; badge and called himself a &#8220;private attorney general,&#8221; which is common among people in the movement.</p>
<p>Anthony Williams: &#8220;That&#8217;s not a de facto government ID. I fly with this ID.</p>
<p>Williams had the ID, a badge, and handcuffs when he was arrested after flying into Fort Lauderdale in November 2015.</p>
<p>We were at the airport when Williams was cuffed, charged with practicing law without a license in a Broward foreclosure case.</p>
<p>Carmel Cafiero: &#8220;Do you think that this is an indication that maybe you don&#8217;t understand the law as well as you think you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony Williams: &#8220;You know I know, and you&#8217;re just as dishonest as they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fast forward five years and more than 4,800 miles. Anthony Williams was in Hawaii, awaiting his fate on far more serious charges.</p>
<p>Anthony Williams: &#8220;I am a private attorney general, or an attorney-in-fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the fact is, Anthony Williams is not a licensed attorney. The Common Law Office of America website he created offered services like mortgage reduction and foreclosure assistance.</p>
<p>After an investigation led by the FBI, Williams was indicted on 32 counts of wire and mail fraud.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say: &#8220;Williams marketed a fraudulent mortgage debt reduction scheme to distressed homeowners, who were mostly non-native English speakers&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>After a four-week trial, where he represented himself, a jury convicted Williams on all charges.</p>
<p>He appeared via video conference at his October sentencing hearing.</p>
<p>Anthony Williams: &#8220;They&#8217;re talking about I targeted vulnerable Filipinos. Filipino people were not the only people that I had as clients. I had Caucasian clients. I had Samoan clients. I had Hawaiian clients. I had African-American clients. I had Hispanic clients. None of them were vulnerable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The feds say Williams &#8220;fraudulently obtained&#8221; more than $230,000 from 112 victims, filing bogus documents &#8220;without providing any legitimate services.&#8221;</p>
<p>Williams maintains his innocence.</p>
<p>Anthony Williams: &#8220;There was nothing that I did that was fraudulent, or intended to be fraudulent, or that was fraudulent, against any homeowner, in any state, let alone here in Hawaii.&#8221;</p>
<p>The judge&#8217;s sentence: 20 years in federal prison.</p>
<p>Judge: &#8220;I believe his sentence provides just punishment, and equally important, I hope it serves as adequate deterrence to others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the years, Williams has repeatedly challenged judges.</p>
<p>Anthony Williams, to judge in 2015: &#8220;Are you going to violate my constitutional rights, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>It hasn&#8217;t worked, whether in South Florida in 2015&#8230;</p>
<p>Anthony Williams, 2015: &#8220;OK, deputy, I need you to arrest this judge for violation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judge: &#8220;OK, we&#8217;re all gonna stop laughing right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or in Hawaii in 2020.</p>
<p>Anthony Williams: &#8220;I just want to place on the record that all of you are going to pay for this. You&#8217;re going to go to jail for this, because I&#8217;m not going to let you violate my rights like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Williams is no longer in Hawaii. He&#8217;s now back in South Florida, here at the Federal Detention Center in Miami, but before he can even begin to serve his 20-year federal sentence, which he&#8217;s already appealed, he must first finish a 15-year sentence in a state grand theft case.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the summer surge, the 7 Investigates team gave us an exclusive look inside Broward Health&#8217;s COVID units. Now, as cases climb yet again, just one station gets access again to see how things have changed. Here&#8217;s 7&#8217;s Kevin Ozebek.</p>
<p>For nine months now, Dr. Sunil Kumar has been leading the COVID-19 intensive care unit inside Broward Health Medical Center.</p>
<p>Dr. Sunil Kumar, Broward Health Medical Center: &#8220;I think we have been able to save a lot of lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>But without question, it has been a difficult year.</p>
<p>We first met Dr. Kumar this summer, when South Florida was the epicenter of the pandemic. This was him in July, as the Broward Health System was treating around 275 COVID patients a day.</p>
<p>Dr. Sunil Kumar: &#8220;It is physically tiring. I think it is emotionally exhausting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since then, the case count has dropped.</p>
<p>This fall, the hospital system was only treating around 30 COVID positive patients a day, but that number has now surged up to around 60 to 70 patients a day.</p>
<p>Dr. Sunil Kumar: &#8220;I am worried. I am concerned. I think, Thanksgiving going into Christmas, there&#8217;s a lot of celebrations.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Nurse Sara Freeman says this surge is easier to handle because of COVID cocktails, which are mixtures of steroids and medications that reduce the levels of the virus and improve symptoms.</p>
<p>Sara Freeman, Broward Health Nurse: &#8220;The patients are less sick, so that frantic feeling that we had during the summer is not quite there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Back in July, we felt that frantic feeling in Nurse Freeman.</p>
<p>Sara Freeman: &#8220;There doesn&#8217;t seem to be light at the end of the tunnel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today&#8230;</p>
<p>Sara Freeman: &#8220;There does seem to be light at the end of the tunnel.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reason why: in just days, the Food and Drug Administration may approve the Pfizer and Moderna-developed vaccines, paving the way for these front-line fighters to be inoculated against COVID-19.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;Are you amazed at how fast this has been developed?</p>
<p>Dave Lacknauth, Broward Health Executive Director of Pharmacy Services: &#8220;Actually shocked, very much so. There&#8217;s a lot of preparation we&#8217;ve got to do behind the scenes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dave Lacknauth runs the in-patient pharmacy at Broward Health. This is a bustling place patients and visitors never see, and it&#8217;s where the vials of COVID vaccines will be stored.</p>
<p>Dave Lacknauth: &#8220;It&#8217;s not in our hands right now, but we are setting up the infrastructure right now, so as soon as you put it in my hands, I&#8217;m storing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right now, this freezer for pharmaceuticals is set at 16.7 degrees Celsius. A freezer like this is perfect for storing the Moderna vaccine that has to be kept at minus 20 degrees Celsius, but for the past two months, the pharmacists here at Broward Health have been sourcing freezers that can go even cooler.</p>
<p>Dave Lacknauth: &#8220;We manage our refrigerated devices in a way where we track the temperature daily, hourly, by the minute. If that temperature goes out of range, we have alarms sounding.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s crucial, considering the Pfizer vaccine will have to be kept at 70 degrees below zero.</p>
<p>With his freezer infrastructure coming into place, Dave sees the end of the pandemic in sight.</p>
<p>Dave Lacknauth: &#8220;It&#8217;s the fourth quarter of the game, we&#8217;re up by a touchdown, the clock is now rolling down where we can just run the clock out. I think everyone needs to be mindful that we&#8217;re almost there.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Nurse Freeman, vaccination lessens the fear of passing COVID from a patient on to her three children.</p>
<p>Sara Freeman: &#8220;It gives us the ability to really come to work and feel safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;And also, does it give you the ability to go home and feel safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sara Freeman: &#8220;Absolutely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;What do you think 2021 is going to be like?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Sunil Kumar: &#8220;I am carefully optimistic.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Dr. Kumar also warns now is not the time to let your guard down. Nine months on, he&#8217;s still self-isolating from his family.</p>
<p>Dr. Sunil Kumar: &#8220;For me, my family is definitely important, so I definitely want to protect them from getting sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says, if he can do that, we can all follow what he calls the &#8220;three w&#8217;s&#8221;: washing our hands, watching our distance and wearing our masks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recent heavy rains combined with Tropical Storm Eta have worsened flooding problems for homeowners in two South Florida cities. Every time it rains, it pours. The Nightteam&#8217;s Karen Hensel with this 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>Miriam Anselem says this is her backyard when it rains.</p>
<p>Miriam Anselem, homeowner: &#8220;Every time there is some rainfall or a little bit of a storm, we end up with lakefront property that we&#8217;re really not interested in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miriam and her neighbors say water runoff from a new development being built next to them is partially to blame.</p>
<p>Kurt Larson, homeowner: &#8220;As it flows down the hill, right there you can see some of the wash outs. There&#8217;s a major one there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their homes are in Dania Beach. The new development is in the City of Hollywood.</p>
<p>A small trailer park used to be here.</p>
<p>Miriam Anselem: &#8220;They had a very large lake that would retain the water.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Dania Beach homes had always drained into that lake, but neighbors say when the developer built the new homes, he shrunk the size of the water retaining lake.</p>
<p>They say he also changed how storm runoff flows, which is when the floods started.</p>
<p>Miriam Anselem: &#8220;It&#8217;s Friday, right now &#8212; Oct. 16 at 5 p.m. &#8212; literally has rained only 10 minutes, and as you can see, water is already coming through into our yard. Today is Oct. 19. It&#8217;s Oct. 21. This is our yard once again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neighbors documented the floods for the last month, but they have known since 2014 this would happen.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when they hired an engineer to address their concerns with the developer.</p>
<p>He sent this letter saying: &#8220;The new development will now cause all of the runoff from the rear yards of the homes &#8230; to be retained on the property &#8230; potentially creating drainage issues for other properties west,&#8221; meaning the new homes being built.</p>
<p>Neighbor: &#8220;We told him before he ever turned a shovel of dirt over there exactly what was going to happen. Now, it&#8217;s happening.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not just the homes that are being affected.</p>
<p>Miriam Anselem: &#8220;They had to detour the street because cars can&#8217;t even pass through over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The developer did not return our calls but has proposed putting a retaining wall here to stop the water. The City of Hollywood is reviewing the permits now, but neighbors here say the permitting process needs to be sped up before permanent damage is done to their homes.</p>
<p>Miriam Anselem: &#8220;This is not an aggravation. Basically, it has become a nightmare for us.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Video of an inmate taking repeated blows to the head inside a Broward County jail cell. The incident happened nearly a year ago, but it has not been exposed until now. 7&#8217;s Karen Hensel has this exclusive investigation: Beaten Behind Bars.</p>
<p>It was Dec. 22, 2019 inside the North Broward Bureau Jail in Pompano Beach.</p>
<p>In surveillance video obtained exclusively by 7 Investigates, Broward Sheriff&#8217;s Office Detention Deputy Wayne Mayberry is seen entering the screen with a female inmate.</p>
<p>Chet Epperson, former police chief: &#8220;Look, the video is very concerning.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deputy and inmate appear to be grabbing each other&#8217;s clothes as she&#8217;s pushed into her cell.</p>
<p>This is what the video captures next.</p>
<p>Deputy Mayberry swings at the inmate.</p>
<p>He then punches her 13 times in rapid succession, using both his right and left fists before throwing her on the floor.</p>
<p>The video ends outside the cell after another deputy closes the door and Mayberry bends over one hand over his eye.</p>
<p>Chet Epperson: &#8220;We have a rather large correctional officer, who is striking the head of a very small woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>A woman who is just 4 feet, 11 inches tall.</p>
<p>We showed the video and incident report to Chet Epperson, a former police chief.</p>
<p>Chet Epperson: &#8220;Even prior to going into the cell, and so I&#8217;m looking at the back of the deputy, you can see his right arm up, so it looks like he&#8217;s going to strike someone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Deputy Mayberry&#8217;s report offers a glimpse into what, he said, happened prior to what we see on video.</p>
<p>After a verbal exchange about a washcloth, he said the inmate &#8220;became belligerent.&#8221;</p>
<p>When she didn&#8217;t comply with orders &#8220;to go back to her room,&#8221; the deputy stated he &#8220;took hold of her right shoulder sleeve.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when Mayberry wrote she &#8220;forcefully struck me in the face and throat, causing my eyeglasses to be knocked off my face&#8221; and yelled &#8220;I&#8217;m going to kill you!&#8221;</p>
<p>And two other inmates gave witness statements saying she went after the deputy, one writing she &#8220;hit him in the face multiple times.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chet Epperson: &#8220;If I&#8217;m escorting the person into the cell, the simple thing to do is just to push that inmate into the cell and close the door. You try to avoid force at all costs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead, at the cell door, Mayberry wrote she &#8220;spit in my face, eyes and mouth&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;gouged something into my right eye&#8221; and said he was &#8220;in fear of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deputy said he &#8220;started hitting her with a closed hammer fist as fast as I could not knowing what I was hitting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chet Epperson: &#8220;At a minimum, at a minimum, there needed &#8212; if there has not been &#8212; an investigation, an internal investigation, that should have taken place.&#8221;</p>
<p>BSO tells 7News they conducted a thorough review of the incident, including the surveillance video, and in a statement said: &#8220;Multiple reviews of the incident, including a preliminary review by BSO&#8217;s division of internal affairs, identified no misconduct by Deputy Mayberry&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>BSO provided us these pictures and said &#8220;Deputy Mayberry suffered serious injuries and required medical treatment at a hospital.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 22-year-old woman is accused of hurting another corrections officer in March at the same jail, a facility primarily for mentally ill and special needs inmates.</p>
<p>That case is being handled in Broward mental health court.</p>
<p>But the inmate was not charged in the incident with Deputy Mayberry. BSO says whether to charge is at the discretion of the deputy, and it&#8217;s not uncommon for deputies assaulted by inmates to decline to file criminal charges because of mental health concerns at this jail.</p>
<p>Full BSO statement (7News has redacted the inmate&#8217;s name since she was not charged in the incident):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px">“On Dec. 22, 2019, Broward Sheriff’s Office Detention Deputy Wayne Mayberry was attacked by a female inmate, [redacted], while he was performing his duties at the North Broward Bureau. The inmate repeatedly scratched and hit Deputy Mayberry in the face and throat, spit in his face and gouged something into one of his eyes. Deputy Mayberry suffered serious injuries and required medical treatment at a hospital.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px">After this incident occurred, BSO’s Department of Detention conducted a thorough review of the matter, as is policy in all use of force. Supervisors reviewed surveillance camera footage, conducted interviews and took photographs of Deputy Mayberry and inmate [redacted]. Inmate [redacted] refused to speak with a BSO lieutenant about the incident. Multiple reviews of the incident, including a preliminary review by BSO’s Division of Internal Affairs, identified no misconduct by Deputy Mayberry as the level of force used by him was an objectively reasonable response to the sudden attack he defended himself from and therefore no Internal Affairs investigation was warranted.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px">Generally speaking, in these types of incidents and based on the totality of the circumstances, it is at the discretion of the deputy whether to file an additional charge against an inmate. It is not uncommon for deputies assaulted by inmates housed in the North Broward Bureau due to mental health concerns to decline criminal charges.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Floridians are already voicing their choice in the 2020 general election, and already, the feds say cyber criminals are spreading disinformation looking to undermine faith in the outcome. The Nightteam&#8217;s Karen Hensel shows us how to separate fact from fiction in tonight&#8217;s 7Investigates.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theories about major events in American history are nothing new.</p>
<p>The moon landing being faked on a Hollywood sound stage.</p>
<p>The Sept. 11th terrorist attacks being carried out by the U.S. government.</p>
<p>The belief the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School was a hoax.</p>
<p>But in recent years, social media has enabled lies and disinformation to spread like a virus.</p>
<p>Professor Joseph Uscinski, University of Miami political science professor: &#8220;About 1 in 3 Americans believe that coronaivirus is a bioweapon either intentionally created or intentionally spread to harm people.&#8221;</p>
<p>And now, conspiracy theories about the 2020 election are front and center.</p>
<p>University of Miami political science Professor Joseph Uscinski is studying the role they&#8217;re playing in a bitterly divided country.</p>
<p>Joseph Uscinski: &#8220;This year, we expect to find that there&#8217;s gonna be a heightened level of people believing in fraud going into the election, and this is largely going to be due to our political leaders talking about fraud quite a bit, and that concerns us.&#8221;</p>
<p>For months, we&#8217;ve heard claims that mail-in ballots will lead to vote rigging.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump: &#8220;We have to be very careful with the ballots. The ballots, that&#8217;s a whole big scam. Everyone knows mail-in ballots are a disaster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Former Vice President Joe Biden: &#8220;All the irresponsible, outrageous attacks on voting &#8212; we&#8217;ll have an election in this country as we always have had.&#8221;</p>
<p>The topic of secure elections was part of a senate hearing in September with testimony from FBI Director Christopher Wray.</p>
<p>Christopher Wray, FBI Director: &#8220;We have not seen, historically, any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the FBI is already warning of &#8220;foreign actors and cyber criminals&#8221; spreading false information &#8220;in an attempt to manipulate public opinion&#8221; and &#8220;discredit the electoral process.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joseph Uscinski: &#8220;There&#8217;s a paradox here, and that is that the people who are going to believe that the vote is rigged against them probably aren&#8217;t going to believe the FBI when it says that it&#8217;s not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week, the heads of four federal agencies in charge of ensuring the security of the election appeared in a video together.</p>
<p>Christopher Wray (in video): &#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Chris Wray, director of the FBI.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gen. Paul M Nakasone (in video): &#8220;I&#8217;m General Paul M. Nakason, Commander of United States Cyber Command and Director of the National Security Agency.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher Krebs: &#8220;I&#8217;m Chris Krebs, Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill Evanina (in video): &#8220;I&#8217;m Bill Evanina, Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center.&#8221;</p>
<p>Authorities sending a united message they&#8217;re on top of any real threats while reassuring Americans.</p>
<p>Christopher Krebs, Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency: &#8220;There&#8217;s been a lot of talk about efforts to hack our elections over the last four years, and some of you might be wondering whether the 2020 elections will be secure. Well, I&#8217;m here today to tell you that my confidence in the security of your vote has never been higher.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Professor Uscinski says people should not equate isolated problems with widespread fraud.</p>
<p>Like, when a mail carrier in New Jersey was arrested for dumping mail that included 99 ballots, but for some, that will be easier said than done.</p>
<p>Joseph Uscinski: &#8220;There are just people out there who think that the system is rigged, and they&#8217;re prone to buying into conspiracy theories, and you will probably be sitting next to one of them at Thanksgiving.&#8221;</p>
<p>Disinformation is designed to make you feel emotions like anger or shock, so before you share or link, stop and think. Question the source and always cross-check questionable claims by searching trusted sites.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Florida is always a crucial swing state in presidential elections, but what makes this year different is the number of mail-in ballots, and thousands of them are rejected in every election. 7&#8217;s Kevin Ozebek investigates.</p>
<p>In Florida, races can come down to razor thin margins.</p>
<p>In 2018, after millions of Floridians cast their ballots, Republican Rick Scott defeated Democrat Bill Nelson for a U.S. Senate seat by just 10,033 votes.</p>
<p>And who can ever forget the election in the year 2000 when George Bush beat Al Gore in Florida by only 537 votes.</p>
<p>An indication that every vote can be critical, but in reality, does every vote count?</p>
<p>Dr. Daniel Smith, University of Florida: &#8220;The problem is we have upwards of 100 times more likelihood of having a ballot rejected if you&#8217;re voting by mail than if you&#8217;re voting in person.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daniel Smith with the University of Florida says in the past two presidential elections, more than 20,000 people in Florida who voted by mail had their ballots rejected.</p>
<p>Daniel Smith: &#8220;Can it make a difference? Absolutely. Republicans and Democrats are equally susceptible to having their ballots not count because of delays to the postal delivery, or because you have made an error of not signing correctly or forgetting to sign.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the 2016 presidential election, 4,015 mail-in ballots were rejected in Miami-Dade County alone.</p>
<p>More than half of them were rejected because the voter did not sign the ballot.</p>
<p>Christina White, Miami-Dade Supervisor of Elections: &#8220;It&#8217;s very easy to vote by mail, but you have to sign it, and the signature has to match.&#8221;</p>
<p>During that same election in Broward County, 1,723 mail-in ballots were rejected.</p>
<p>Again, the vast majority were rejected because of no signature.</p>
<p>Peter Antonacci, Broward County Supervisor of Elections: &#8220;As soon as you get your ballot, fill it out, make your choices known, sign your ballot and get it in quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Supervisors of elections in both Broward and Miami-Dade say despite those numbers, voting by mail is still a good option if you don&#8217;t want to vote in person.</p>
<p>Christina White: &#8220;Trust the process. I believe it is safe and secure.&#8221;</p>
<p>To ensure your ballot counts, follow the instructions and sign it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a good idea to fill out the contact information section, so if there&#8217;s a problem with your ballot, someone can reach you, and the sooner you vote by mail, the better.</p>
<p>Peter Antonacci: &#8220;Bring it on! Send it to me! I want to have it as quickly as possible, so we can do what needs to be done to make sure it counts.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Florida, mail-in ballots are counted as soon as they are received, so after you send in your ballot, you can go online to make sure it was counted. We have the links below.</p>
<p>This is just one of the stories the 7 Investigates team is looking into about safe and accurate voting.</p>
<p>Karen Hensel is already investigating cyber criminals who are trying to undermine our faith in a free and fair process.</p>
<p>Coming up Tuesday on 7News at 10 p.m., how to spot and stop the spread of disinformation.</p>
<p>And if you have anything election-related you want Karen and me to investigate, we want to hear from you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Florida detectives say two attorneys were part of a sophisticated fraud scheme. They&#8217;re accused of stealing checks in foreclosure cases from people both alive and dead. Kevin Ozebek has tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>The Broward Sheriff&#8217;s Office dubbed it &#8220;Operation Claim Game&#8221; and say the four players include two South Florida attorneys: Rashida Overby and Ria Sankar-Balram.</p>
<p>Carey Codd, Broward Sheriff&#8217;s Office: &#8220;These attorneys are officers of the court, and they are accused of filing false pleadings with the court, in essence lying to judges in Broward County, trying to get money that did not belong to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Detectives say more than $740,000 was stolen in a sophisticated scheme to defraud victims both alive and dead.</p>
<p>Carey Codd: &#8220;It appears they were targeting deceased individuals.&#8221;</p>
<p>The case centers around foreclosure surplus checks, money left over after mortgage and other obligations in foreclosure cases are paid off.</p>
<p>But instead of the money going back to elderly property owners &#8212; or, if they had died, family or representatives &#8212; investigators say the attorneys diverted the checks to their own accounts.</p>
<p>Carey Codd: &#8220;The investigation revealed that these attorneys did not represent these people, and that money never made it to the rightful recipients. One of the victims in these cases said he was in such financial distress that he struggled to pay for his mother&#8217;s funeral.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overby appeared via video conference in Broward bond court Tuesday.</p>
<p>Judge: &#8220;The allegations outlined in the probable cause affidavit are rather disturbing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The attorneys are not the only ones facing charges that include grand theft and money laundering.</p>
<p>Detectives say some of the stolen money was wired to Illya and Patricia Tinker.</p>
<p>Judge: &#8220;The defendant is guilty of aggravated white-collar crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>7News viewers may remember the Tinkers. <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/investigations/south-florida-family-nicknamed-tomb-raiders-convicted-of-stealing-homes-from-dead-people/">Our cameras were in the courtroom last year</a> when the couple was convicted and handcuffed in another fraud case.</p>
<p>Judge: &#8220;The defendant is guilty of criminal use of deceased individual&#8217;s personal identification information.&#8221;</p>
<p>BSO called the Tinkers tomb raiders for stealing homes from the estates of dead people and forging fake documents for fraudulent resale.</p>
<p>Detectives say they uncovered the new scheme after the Tinkers were sentenced.</p>
<p>The Tinkers will remain locked up because of their previous cases.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Overby remains in Broward County Jail after her arrest.</p>
<p>Sankar-Balram has already been released from jail after posting bond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Complaints are pouring in from across the country about a popular money sharing app. The app reportedly has 30 million users, but little help for those who lose money to scammers. 7&#8217;s Karen Hensel shows us why so many feel cash zapped.</p>
<p>Kyle Hite, Cash App user: &#8220;I was scammed out of $4,700.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thousands of dollars lost&#8230;</p>
<p>Tamika Lea, Cash App user: &#8220;Two thousand, one-hundred seventeen dollars is what I was scammed out of.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scammed out of cash on Cash App.</p>
<p>The popular tool lets people easily transfer money to one another on smartphones, but it has also been abused by scammers who have tricked countless users into giving them access to their accounts and money.</p>
<p>Calls from people across the country have flooded our 7 Investigates tip line.</p>
<p>Kyle Hite (voicemail): &#8220;I had a very unfortunate mishap with Cash App.&#8221;</p>
<p>From Kyle in California&#8230;</p>
<p>Kyle Hite: &#8220;They used some software through an app to log into my phone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;to Tamika in Louisiana&#8230;</p>
<p>Tamika Lea: &#8220;My money was gone within three minutes. I sent Cash App 20 emails and have not heard anything back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;to Anika Sands here in South Florida.</p>
<p>Anika Sandsr: &#8220;It was devastating. I was very upset.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anika says she lost nearly $10,000 after Googling Cash App support.</p>
<p>She called an 800 number for help and thought she was talking to someone from the app but wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Instead, the person on the other end was a scammer who drained her account.</p>
<p>Anika Sands: &#8220;They literally took the phone call, and they walked my son through it, and then, they actually had my son open his phone to remote control it. At the same time, all the while, he was taking everything out of the account.&#8221;</p>
<p>But getting a representative with the real Cash App?</p>
<p>Anika Sands: &#8220;Very frustrated with Cash App because it&#8217;s like there&#8217;s nobody you can talk to.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she&#8217;s right. The multi-billion dollar company with millions of users does have one legitimate phone number, but you can&#8217;t speak to anyone. It&#8217;s just a recording.</p>
<p>Cash App recording: &#8220;Live phone support is not generally available at this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the recording makes clear Cash App knows there&#8217;s a problem.</p>
<p>Cash App recording: &#8220;Please be aware that Cash App employees are often impersonated by scammers circulating fake phone numbers online.&#8221;</p>
<p>7 Investigates first exposed the issue two years ago.</p>
<p>Holly Apetz, Cash App user, October 2018: &#8220;Within minutes, I hear my other phone &#8216;ding, ding,&#8217; and he&#8217;s taking all my money &#8212; $96, $99, $199.&#8221;</p>
<p>We even listened as one scammer turned nasty.</p>
<p>Fake rep, September 2018: &#8220;You are a jobless [expletive].&#8221;</p>
<p>Woman: &#8220;Oh, no, we&#8217;re doing it for Channel 7 News, sweetheart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fake rep: &#8220;Oh, shut up, you [expletive].&#8221;</p>
<p>But since then, complaints continue to mount.</p>
<p>The Florida Attorney General&#8217;s office tells 7News, &#8220;We do not have a consumer protection investigation against Cash App at this time, although we are reviewing complaints against the company.&#8221;</p>
<p>And 4,020 consumers, who reported losing nearly $3 million &#8212; filed Cash App complaints with the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
<p>Professor Paul Borochin, University of Miami: &#8220;The fact that they literally don&#8217;t have a customer service number is somewhat egregious.&#8221;</p>
<p>University of Miami Business School Professor Paul Borochin says banks and credit cards provide more protection.</p>
<p>Paul Borochin: &#8220;It&#8217;s really important for users of these apps to understand that there is no safety net. They come with great convenience for the customer, for the consumer but also with substantial downsides.&#8221;</p>
<p>Borochin says when it comes to money sharing apps, technology is outpacing regulation.</p>
<p>So who could regulate these apps?</p>
<p>Paul Borochin: &#8220;It may actually be some of the regulatory bodies that oversee banks.&#8221;</p>
<p>We asked the California-based Cash App why they don&#8217;t provide live customer support.</p>
<p>They simply sent us a transcript of their recorded message warning of the impostor phone numbers.</p>
<p>Tuesday, Cash App&#8217;s parent company told 7News they are looking into the cases of the three users featured in our report.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A South Florida mayor is accused of breaking election law. Now, one town official is taking action, saying she should leave office immediately. 7&#8217;s Kevin Ozebek investigates.</p>
<p>Pembroke Park Commissioner Geoffrey Jacobs says Mayor Ashira Mohammed needs to resign right now.</p>
<p>Geoffrey Jacobs: &#8220;She&#8217;s still continuing to make decisions that affect the town, and she has no legal right to be doing that at this point.&#8221;</p>
<p>He has filed this lawsuit saying Mayor Mohammed &#8220;&#8230; is violating Florida law every day that she refuses to leave office. She must be removed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commissioner Jacobs is working with attorney Michael Pizzi.</p>
<p>Michael Pizzi: &#8220;It&#8217;s never good to have a mayor in office when it&#8217;s illegal, when they have no right to be there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges Mayor Mohammed violated the resign-to-run law by not stepping down as mayor back in May, as she was also running for state representative.</p>
<p>And it is not just Commissioner Jacobs who thinks Mayor Mohammed violated the law. Last week, the Broward Office of Inspector General released a report concluding Mayor Mohammed engaged in what it calls elections misconduct.</p>
<p>Mayor Mohammed&#8217;s attorney says she has already vowed to resign, after the November election.</p>
<p>Joseph Geller, attorney: &#8220;This is ridiculous. There&#8217;s about a month to go before the resignation, and the court has no authority to remove someone from office for this statute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Besides not resigning, the inspector general also took issue with Mayor Mohammed posting her campaign logo on the town&#8217;s Facebook page and says she used town resources for her law firm.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the 7 Investigates team <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/video-shows-pembroke-park-mayor-town-employee-leaving-town-hall-with-documents-after-accessing-offices-after-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">obtained surveillance video</a> that raises more questions.</p>
<p>It shows Mayor Mohammed, at the time she was under investigation by the inspector general, inside town hall on the night of Memorial Day.</p>
<p>She was with a now former town employee who appeared to grab a hammer to try and open an office door.</p>
<p>They ended up entering the office with keys.</p>
<p>Later in the night, she leaves with a second town employee, and a box and stack of documents.</p>
<p>Mayor Mohammed&#8217;s attorney says she was just making copies of resumes for the inspector general for an unrelated matter.</p>
<p>The Broward Sheriff&#8217;s Office tells 7News there is an active and ongoing investigation.</p>
<p>As for this new lawsuit asking a judge for Mayor Mohammed&#8217;s immediate removal, a town spokesperson tells us, &#8220;…the town has just become aware of this legal filing. Typically, we do not comment on pending legal matters.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a parent, nothing is more terrifying than the thought of your child going missing. One Fort Lauderdale family knows that pain, and now, more than three years after their 15-year-old daughter disappeared, the 7 Investigates team is learning new details about the case. Here&#8217;s 7&#8217;s Kevin Ozebek.</p>
<p>Sophie Reeder had a smile that lit up her face.</p>
<p>Detective Jennifer Saint-Jean, Fort Lauderdale Police: &#8220;I think about it all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Detective Jennifer Saint-Jean says this is the case that haunts her. This mother of five would like nothing more than to find out what happened to Sophie.</p>
<p>Detective Jennifer Saint-Jean: &#8220;I constantly think about what can I do different? What can I look at? What angle can I think of?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sophie disappeared more than three years ago, on May 20th, 2017, while she was out for a late night walk.</p>
<p>Her parents are divorced, and at the time, she was living with her father.</p>
<p>Detective Jennifer Saint-Jean: &#8220;We know that she did on a regular basis go for walks, so that wasn&#8217;t necessarily unusual. The unusual part is when she didn&#8217;t come back home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Court records obtained by 7 Investigates show Sophie left her father&#8217;s house with &#8220;&#8230; a candle burning in her bedroom&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;&#8230; $300.00 cash in a bag near her bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>All signs she did not run away.</p>
<p>Detective Jennifer Saint-Jean: &#8220;She walked down the street, kind of meandered in the area for a while, then we have her going eastbound on Davie Boulevard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fort Lauderdale Police used cell tower records and Google account locations to make a map of Sophie&#8217;s route.</p>
<p>Security camera video shows Sophie walking through the neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Detective Jennifer Saint-Jean: &#8220;She&#8217;s by herself. Other than that, we have no idea what she was doing in the area.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sophie&#8217;s phone either died or was turned off at Southwest 11th Court in Fort Lauderdale.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;There&#8217;s no question: she was in this neighborhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Detective Jennifer Saint-Jean: &#8220;Absolutely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;That night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Detective Jennifer Saint-Jean: &#8220;That&#8217;s not a question.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;Through early morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Detective Jennifer Saint-Jean: &#8220;Right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;And this is her last known whereabouts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Detective Jennifer Saint-Jean: &#8220;It is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before her phone signal dropped, detectives believe she was in contact with two men in this neighborhood. Police suspect both men at the time were dealing in dark, dangerous and illegal underground activity.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;So you can tell us now, a suspected drug dealer, a suspected trafficker?&#8221;</p>
<p>Detective Jennifer Saint-Jean: &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sophie&#8217;s mom, Nicole, says she had been worried about her daughter.</p>
<p>Nicole Twist, Sophie&#8217;s mother: &#8220;When I went through her room, I saw things like stockings and garter belts, booze, drugs. I&#8217;m just surprised that she would even think about bringing that to my house. She picked the wrong crowd to hang out with, and I totally believe social media and being on the computer and talking to the wrong people led to her disappearance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police say Sophie would go on websites to find so-called &#8220;sugar daddies,&#8221; men who want relationships with young women.</p>
<p>And young women looking for older men can sometimes be forced into sex trafficking.</p>
<p>Detective Jennifer Saint-Jean: &#8220;It&#8217;s very prevalent in South Florida and, unfortunately, it&#8217;s so easy to get entangled into it and not even know necessarily right away that you&#8217;re involved in it until you&#8217;re so deep into it that you don&#8217;t know how to get out.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Sophie is still alive, she is 18 years old now. A poster shows what she might look like, but what it doesn&#8217;t show is the kind of life she might be living.</p>
<p>Nicole Twist: &#8220;As a mom, I have conflicting feelings that, even if &#8230; maybe it would be better for her to be dead than have the life that she&#8217;s having now. What does she have to do to survive? I just could imagine what kind of hell &#8230; I think she&#8217;s probably strung out on drugs and having to prostitute.&#8221;</p>
<p>That fear is the reason Detective Saint-Jean will not give up the search.</p>
<p>Detective Jennifer Saint-Jean: &#8220;The grim reality is, she could be in a very dark situation right now, which is why we&#8217;re hoping for any tips or any leads that could get us information so that we could locate her safely.&#8221;</p>
<p>She will not close the case until she gets an answer to the question: what happened to Sophie Reeder?</p>
<p>Sophie&#8217;s father declined our request for an interview. If you have any information on Sophie Reeder, call the Fort Lauderdale Police Department&#8217;s Anonymous Tip Line at 954-828-5534.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some students at a South Florida high school are buzzing after a virtual class was video bombed with porn and a racist rant. It&#8217;s tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates with Karen Hensel.</p>
<p>The video is alarming and disturbing.</p>
<p>From video: &#8220;[Expletive] you, [expletive].&#8221;</p>
<p>A Cypress Bay High School virtual PE class was in session with teacher and popular former football coach Mark Guandolo.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s coach, in the upper left.</p>
<p>But this class turned crass.</p>
<p>From video: &#8220;Shut the [expletive] up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The video, now circulating on Snapchat among students, started with a quick clip of porn&#8230;</p>
<p>From video: &#8220;Oh, my God&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Annoying sounds&#8230;</p>
<p>And then it turned racist.</p>
<p>The N-word is heard 21 times in the 41-second video.</p>
<p>Father of student: &#8220;It was shocking for my child.&#8221;</p>
<p>This father, who is black, asked we not show his face. His teenager is a student at Cypress Bay, and he saw the video when it was shared on social media.</p>
<p>Father: &#8220;The constant repetition, it really stirs up an emotion in you because there is a lot of history behind that word.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since spring, when schools across the country went virtual, many relied on video conference services like Zoom or Microsoft Teams, and with this new way of learning came warnings.</p>
<p>Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody: &#8220;Zoombombing is the latest trend threatening online privacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody warned in April about what became known as &#8220;Zoombombing,&#8221; uninvited guests crashing virtual meetings and classrooms.</p>
<p>The FBI also issued a warning, and the kids are sick of it, too.</p>
<p>Posted on Snapchat: &#8220;na, this [expletive] not even funny why&#8217;d you have to do coach g like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Someone also tried to verbally stop the intrusion into the gym class.</p>
<p>From video: &#8220;You need to remove [name of person].&#8221;</p>
<p>But then someone else tried to shut her down.</p>
<p>From video: &#8220;Shut the [expletive] up, shut the [expletive] up, shut the [expletive] up. [Expletive] you, [expletive].&#8221;</p>
<p>From video: &#8220;Coach, remove that&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The head of the Broward Teachers Union hopes the person can be caught.</p>
<p>Anna Fusco, Broward Teachers Union President: &#8220;Capturing it on tape is going to help our district find out who it was that did it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unauthorized visitors in this case could be fellow students.</p>
<p>In a statement to 7News, Broward Schools says the incident was &#8220;&#8230; determined not to be the result of a hacking. The school&#8217;s leadership continues to investigate the matter to identify those involved and is reviewing security protocols to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>The district also says students could face discipline.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, parents say it&#8217;s frustrating, and the schools should have solved the problem by now.</p>
<p>Father: &#8220;It&#8217;s just like going to the school; you&#8217;re screened before you go into the school. There should not be unauthorized visitors within the classroom environment whether it be virtual or a live classroom, a physical classroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>While students will soon be headed back to the classroom, others will continue learning from home, which is why parents don&#8217;t want their kids to get any more unwanted lessons.</p>

<p>This story is a continuation of a <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/investigations/former-pembroke-park-employee-sues-town-claims-he-was-bullied-sexually-harassed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7 Investigates from several weeks ago</a> when we looked into a town employee accused of sending pornographic and harassing emails on town cellphone.</p>
<p>The mayor of Pembroke Park was found by the Office of Inspector General last week to have engaged in ethical misconduct. Now, she was also running for a statewide office in Tallahassee, and she has also told the town hall she is now going to resign on Nov. 4, one day after the election.</p>
<p>Now, the 7 Investigates team has obtained surveillance video that is raising even more questions about what was happening inside the town hall at Pembroke Park.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Memorial Day, a public holiday, but that evening, security cameras show Mayor Ashira Mohammed arriving at town hall with a woman who, 7News sources said, is a town employee.</p>
<p>Around 7:30 p.m., they try to open a door to an administrative office where some town documents are stored, but they can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Then, parks director Chris McKine arrives at town hall.</p>
<p>He gets a hammer and takes it to the door, but they don&#8217;t break in. Instead, they end up entering the office through another door using keys.</p>
<p>Later in the night, the mayor is seen going in and out of the public works office &#8212; at times with documents in hand.</p>
<p>She and the town employee she arrived with left town hall around 10:35 p.m. with a box and a stack of documents.</p>
<p>At the time, Mayor Mohammed was under investigation by the Broward Office of the Inspector General, which was requesting several documents from the town.</p>
<p>That investigation concluded last week found the mayor &#8220;&#8230;engaged in ethical misconduct by using the town&#8217;s resources and her official position to benefit her law firm&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>We wanted answers from the town but got this email: &#8220;Out of respect for the ongoing investigation by the Broward Sheriff&#8217;s Office, we&#8217;re not able to provide further comment.&#8221;</p>
<p>BSO won&#8217;t confirm whether the mayor herself is under investigation, but we do know this surveillance video is mentioned in a BSO report after the cellphone of the town&#8217;s parks director, Chris McKine, was stolen in June.</p>
<p>7 Investigates confronted both the mayor and McKine last month regarding a different story.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;Would you like to say anything about why you were sending this on a town phone to one of your employees?&#8221;</p>
<p>Chris McKine: &#8220;I have no comment.&#8221;</p>
<p>7News learned Pembroke Park was being sued after McKine was accused of sending pornographic and harassing text messages on his town phone. He has now been terminated as parks director.</p>
<p>As for this Memorial Day video, Mayor Mohammed&#8217;s personal attorney said the mayor was in town hall making copies of resumes she wanted to send to the Office of Inspector General for a matter unrelated to the investigation into her.</p>
<p>Joe Geller, attorney: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s particularly suspicious for the mayor to be going into town hall to perform her duty. It&#8217;s unfortunate that she didn&#8217;t get the right key, and only when she found she couldn&#8217;t otherwise access, did she call an on-duty town employee to assist her with getting access, so she could go in and make copies of public record. No originals were disturbed.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, 7 Investigates also has the time cards of both McKine and that other town employee who was with the mayor that night.</p>
<p>McKine did put down that he should get eight hours since it was a federal holiday, but the time card does not show him clocking in or out that day. The same goes for that other employee who was with the mayor that night.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a deal meant to bring in much-needed money to a Miami-Dade condo building, so why are homeowners now furious? Kevin Ozebek has tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>Summer in South Florida can bring intense storms, and for some owners in this condo building, when it rains, water can come right into their homes.</p>
<p>Johanna Miranda: &#8220;The roof keeps leaking, and when it rains really bad, it&#8217;s even worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Residents at the Visions at Fontainebleau condos say their roof needs to be replaced.</p>
<p>Johanna Miranda, condo owner: &#8220;So, we have tried to get it fixed, but nobody wants to get on that job.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem: big cell service antennas are mounted at the corners of the roof with this control unit in the center.</p>
<p>Roof repair crews are afraid to get near them.</p>
<p>Johanna Miranda: &#8220;They came, they did an estimate, and when they saw the antennas, they refused to do the work.&#8221;</p>
<p>These are warnings posted right next to the roof entrance.</p>
<p>The yellow sign says to &#8220;use personal radiofrequency monitors&#8221; and to &#8220;maintain 3 feet clearance from antennas.&#8221;</p>
<p>The white one warns that radio frequency levels &#8220;may exceed FCC safety limits for exposure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even though the FCC says &#8220;exposures exceeding the guidelines &#8230; are only likely to be encountered very close to, and directly in front of, the antennas,&#8221; roofers don&#8217;t want to take the job, and the damage is only getting worse.</p>
<p>Emilio Pardo, condo association president: &#8220;The leaking, the continual leaking, the cracking, it&#8217;s very bad. It&#8217;s very bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emilio believes the building needs to get rid of the antennas, so he wanted to see the original deal, but the board has changed so many times since the antennas were installed in 2014, the details were hard to find.</p>
<p>But when Emilio did locate them&#8230;</p>
<p>Emilio Pardo: &#8220;Wow! Twenty-five years! It&#8217;s too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Former board members leased roof space to a cell company in a deal that automatically renews every five years until 2039.</p>
<p>In exchange, the association received a one-time payment of $4,500 plus monthly rent of $1,800.</p>
<p>Johanna Miranda: &#8220;There were no meetings, or at least they weren&#8217;t advised that it was going to be discussed.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Johanna Miranda, there was no debate and no discussion before everything was installed.</p>
<p>Johanna Miranda: &#8220;Just one or two people from the association that worked on this.&#8221;</p>
<p>7News reached out to the former board president who signed the lease. She has not returned our message.</p>
<p>Residents say the income from the antennas do not help if they can&#8217;t get the roof fixed.</p>
<p>Johanna Miranda: &#8220;The main goal is for them to remove the antennas, and then, from there, everything can start getting repaired.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the antennas cannot be removed, residents say they still have to find a roofing company willing to work around them. In the meantime, there may be more trouble ahead because they have learned the antennas are set to be replaced with new ones.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Losing a pet is hard enough, but a South Florida pet owner says having to continue to pay for his dead dog&#8217;s health plan is making things even worse. 7&#8217;s Karen Hensel investigates.</p>
<p>It is never easy losing a best friend.</p>
<p>Back in April, Laszlo Ambrus had to say goodbye to his 16-year-old wire fox terrier.</p>
<p>Laszlo Ambrus, Shuti&#8217;s owner: &#8220;We called him Shuti. It means &#8216;Cookie&#8217; in Hungarian.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Laszlo adopted Shuti, he signed up for an Optimum Wellness Plan from Banfield Pet Hospital.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an annual health care package that costs $53 a month and could be cancelled at any time.</p>
<p>Laszlo Ambrus: &#8220;Pretty much covers basic procedures, give us discounts on vaccines and pills.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Shuti passed away in April, Laszlo called Banfield&#8217;s 800 number to cancel the wellness plan, but there was a problem.</p>
<p>He says no one picked up the phone.</p>
<p>Laszlo Ambrus: &#8220;Tried to call them, nobody was answering the phone, tried to email them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laszlo&#8217;s dog died just as the coronavirus forced businesses to close.</p>
<p>He tried to cancel the plan before the next automatic payment in May, but no one responded, so he decided to cancel the credit card.</p>
<p>Laszlo Ambrus: &#8220;So that&#8217;s when they started calling me. I told them the dog passed away in April. They said, &#8216;It doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8217; that I have to pay for the remaining of the year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laszlo was told he would keep being charged until the plan ran out in November.</p>
<p>He has now missed seven months of payments totaling more than $370, and his account was recently sent to collections.</p>
<p>Laszlo Ambrus: &#8220;They said actually, &#8216;Sorry,&#8217; but also, &#8216;Sorry, they cannot do anything about it.&#8217; I have to pay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Banfield&#8217;s website says &#8220;Optimum Wellness agreements may be cancelled at any time&#8221; unless there is a balance owed for an unpaid service.</p>
<p>Laszlo says he didn&#8217;t have any unpaid services.</p>
<p>We contacted Banfield&#8217;s corporate office to ask why he was still being charged.</p>
<p>They told 7News that they would look into it, and a few days later, we got this email from Laszlo: &#8220;They just called to let us know the balance is zero and cancelled the collection as well. Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Banfield also emailed 7News saying, &#8220;As with all of our clients &#8230; we work directly with the family if there are any concerns. We&#8217;re glad that we were able to find a mutually agreeable solution &#8230; and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this caused.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laszlo Ambrus: &#8220;He liked to hunt for lizards in the garden. He loved apples, best friend I ever can have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laszlo still misses Shuti, and despite this issue, he says he would consider buying the plan again if he ever gets a new pet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The race is on to develop a COVID-19 vaccine and hopes are high one may be approved for emergency use within the next six months, but is the federal government rushing the process? 7&#8217;s Kevin Ozebek investigates.</p>
<p>David Kent, taking part in vaccine trial: &#8220;Here we go.&#8221;</p>
<p>David Kent is giving it a shot. The Oakland Park resident is participating in clinical trials for what could be the first COVID-19 vaccine approved by the federal government.</p>
<p>David Kent: &#8220;Somebody&#8217;s got to. Somebody&#8217;s actually got to step forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thirty-thousand Americans across the country have stepped forward. They are all testing a vaccine being developed by biotech giant Moderna and the U.S. government&#8217;s National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>Researchers say it&#8217;s one of the most promising vaccines being studied.</p>
<p>Eighty-three-year-old Dolores Trubinski of Coconut Creek is also getting the shot.</p>
<p>Dolores Trubinski: &#8220;My children said, &#8216;Are you crazy? Do you know things could happen to you?'&#8221; I said, &#8216;Why not me?&#8217; I&#8217;m for humanity. I just think of humanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>To make sure there are no adverse reactions to the injections, Dolores and David will return three times this month to Research Centers of America. It&#8217;s a lab in Oakland Park that administers clinical trials.</p>
<p>Dr. Howard Schwartz, Research Centers of America: &#8220;To date, fortunately, we haven&#8217;t really seen any significant side effects.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Howard Schwartz has helped in some 1,000 clinical trials, but he says the trials happening here for the Moderna vaccine and two other COVID vaccines are unlike any other.</p>
<p>Dr. Howard Schwartz: &#8220;Operation Warp Speed is like nothing we&#8217;ve seen before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Operation Warp Speed is the federal government&#8217;s nearly $10 billion effort to have at least one proven safe vaccine by the start of 2021.</p>
<p>Dr. Howard Schwartz: &#8220;As in everything that&#8217;s done with regulation, it takes time, and so some of those timelines have been somewhat shortened. For example, when we enroll people in a trial, if we were going to enroll 300 to 400 individuals in a trial, it may occur over six months. Over here, that&#8217;s probably going to occur over 60 days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Participants like Dolores and David are usually monitored for several years before approval, but given the impact of the pandemic, the federal government has made finding a vaccine a priority. That means, after six months of collecting data, U.S. regulators might give emergency approval for the vaccine candidate.</p>
<p>Researchers worry how the public will react.</p>
<p>Dr. Aileen Marty, infectious disease specialist, Florida International University: &#8220;If you push it too fast for political reasons, you&#8217;re going to have people be skeptical of something that might actually turn out to be a safe and effective vaccine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Aileen Marty of FIU says a year&#8217;s worth of data would definitely be better, but she also believes in doctors like Anthony Fauci, who are leading the way in the fight against COVID.</p>
<p>Dr. Aileen Marty: &#8220;If, in fact, we have no significant negative complications after six months in a substantial number of well spread out, different demographics, that we may, by January or February, have a vaccine we could possibly give to our population. I&#8217;m very optimistic, but again, we have to wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>David is optimistic, too.</p>
<p>David Kent: &#8220;One small shot for me, one big shot for mankind.&#8221;</p>
<p>He hopes his participation leads to an end to this global pandemic.</p>
<p>The 7 Investigates team also reached out to Moderna. We never got a response, but the company has said it looks forward to demonstrating the potential of its vaccine candidate so the pandemic can be defeated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Residents of a South Florida condo building have a pool problem, and it could take 50 years &#8212; yes, 50 years &#8212; to fix. Karen Hensel explains in tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>The pool at the Maison Grande Condominium on Miami Beach is currently closed for repairs.</p>
<p>It may even have to be replaced, but once the pool is fixed and filled, the money being sunk into it will not stop because the pool problems here go much deeper.</p>
<p>Alan DelForn, unit owner: &#8220;We&#8217;re looking at three generations that are paying for this pool.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three generations, or 99 years to be exact.</p>
<p>Part of the monthly maintenance fees for the 502 condo owners here goes to lease their own pool because it&#8217;s not actually theirs to begin with and hasn&#8217;t been since the building opened in 1971.</p>
<p>Kim Alessi has lived here since 2011.</p>
<p>Kim Alessi, unit owner: &#8220;What he did was he sectioned off and kept a portion of the property where the pool was going to be built.&#8221;</p>
<p>In what&#8217;s called a recreational lease, the building&#8217;s developer retained ownership of the pool and a portion of the deck.</p>
<p>The condo owners are charged to use it, even when they can&#8217;t swim in it.</p>
<p>Kim Alessi: &#8220;The pool has been closed since June of 2019, and we still had to pay $75,000 a month for a closed pool that no one can use.&#8221;</p>
<p>This July, the payment was $77,000, meaning the association is on track to spend more than $920,000 just this year for the pool! And if it ends up needing to be replaced, unit owners will be responsible for the cost but still won&#8217;t own it.</p>
<p>Kim Alessi: &#8220;It says that we&#8217;re responsible for all maintenance, for all taxes. We have to insure it.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point, you may be wondering how this is even legal? And it&#8217;s not anymore, but it was when the lease was signed, and that has condo owners here locked into a losing legal battle. They have lost in both state and federal courts.</p>
<p>Alexander Turner, real estate attorney: &#8220;The Florida Supreme Court said a contract is a contract, and even though it may be very unfair, you know, everybody knew what they were getting into when they got into it, or at least that&#8217;s the presumption.&#8221;</p>
<p>Real estate attorney Alexander Turner says these kinds of leases were common back in the early &#8217;70s.</p>
<p>Alexander Turner: &#8220;The legislature actually banned these things. They said no more leases after 1975 because some of these leases were literally 99 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brenda Torres, condo unit owner: &#8220;I know there&#8217;s been several generations of owners who have tried to address this matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brenda Torres has owned a unit at Maison Grande for four years and is a former board member.</p>
<p>She says the pool payments have a ripple effect.</p>
<p>Brenda Torres: &#8220;We have to forgo certain improvements in the building, certain crucial improvements because first we have this obligation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unit owners are hoping by speaking out, state lawmakers will step in to help.</p>
<p>Kim Alessi: &#8220;The condo regulation laws need to be changed to reflect that this is not a proper law and void this lease out. We&#8217;ve paid for 49 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alan DelForn: &#8220;And it still has another 50-plus years to go, which means that they&#8217;re going to be collecting another roughly $75 million, and anyone in their right mind would go &#8216;What are you, crazy? One hundred million dollars for a pool?'&#8221;</p>
<p>We reached out to the developer and family trust that collects the lease payments but have not heard back.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, unit owners see no end in sight.</p>
<p>Brenda Torres: &#8220;We have grandmothers, grandfathers. We have single mothers, young families, and from every angle, I mean, it just doesn&#8217;t seem fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fair or not, this swimming pool saga could continue until the lease ends in the year 2070.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number of COVID cases are now declining, but in Miami-Dade County alone, the pandemic has taken 2,600 lives and caused lingering economic devastation. Could much of this loss have been prevented by the Florida Department of Health? 7&#8217;s Kevin Ozebek investigates.</p>
<p>It was mid-July.</p>
<p>Diana Diaz, Today in Florida anchor: &#8220;Florida smashing a national record.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cases of COVID-19 were surging.</p>
<p>Miami Mayor Francis Suarez: &#8220;If something is not done to dramatically alter our course, we could be in a more dire situation than what we&#8217;re in.&#8221;</p>
<p>But when South Florida was the epicenter of the pandemic, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, a Republican, and Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber, a Democrat, say the state&#8217;s contact tracing program missed the mark.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;So, on an A-F scale, what would you grade them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber: &#8220;I would grade our effort, obviously, an F.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miami Mayor Francis Suarez: &#8220;I&#8217;d probably give them a D or a C, simply because of effort, but in terms of the actual performance, it has not been there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Contact tracer 1 (dramatization): &#8220;Have you stayed in quarantine today?&#8221;</p>
<p>In a pandemic, contact tracers call those who test positive. Ideally, they give crucial information.</p>
<p>Contact tracer 2 (dramatization): &#8220;Please self-isolate.&#8221;</p>
<p>And get crucial information.</p>
<p>Contact tracer 1 (dramatization): &#8220;Who did you spend time with before testing positive?&#8221;</p>
<p>So they can contact others who may have been exposed to stop them from infecting anyone else.</p>
<p>Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber: &#8220;So the idea is, you control the outbreak, you cabinet, you stop it from spreading further, and that&#8217;s the key.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Mayor Gelber says contact tracing was wholly inadequate.</p>
<p>He gave 7News a Department of Health graph which shows contract tracing between July 9th to July 22nd. Miami-Dade County was seeing around 2,000 to 3,000 new infections daily.</p>
<p>But the Health Department&#8217;s contact tracers were speaking to, on average, just under 500 newly infected people a day.</p>
<p>Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber: &#8220;As soon as we saw all this, we immediately called on the governor to provide a proper number of contact tracers to Dade County. If you look at the standards, we should have had well over 800, probably 1,000, so obviously, we were set up for failure.&#8221;</p>
<p>But back in mid-July, the Health Department told 7News it had about 300 contact tracers working in Miami-Dade County.</p>
<p>We asked to meet some, but that request was denied.</p>
<p>However, we did find a contact tracer who in July worked in Central Florida, and her story raises even more questions.</p>
<p>Adrienne Barker, former contact tracer: &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a lot of talent, Kevin, but the one talent I have is I&#8217;m likable, and so, for that, I thought I would make a great contact tracer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adrienne Barker of Daytona Beach showed us the pay stubs to prove she was a contact tracer working for a staffing company used by the State Department of Health.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;In your four weeks technically on the job, did you ever make one phone call to someone who is COVID-19 positive?&#8221;</p>
<p>Adrienne Barker: &#8220;No, nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;Not one?&#8221;</p>
<p>Adrienne Barker: &#8220;Not one.&#8221;</p>
<p>During her month on the job in Brevard and Seminole counties, Adrienne said, she begged to make calls but was never given a single assignment.</p>
<p>Adrienne Barker: &#8220;There is definitely a lack of accountability and oversight, and it&#8217;s serious. I was getting paid $23 an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Back here in Miami-Dade County, after our requests for an interview with the State Health Department were not granted&#8230;</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;Hi this is Kevin Ozebek.&#8221;</p>
<p>We went to the administration office.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;Is there anyone we can talk to right now about the contact tracing program?&#8221;</p>
<p>No luck, but in an email, the Department of Health&#8217;s Miami-Dade office tells us, now in the county, &#8220;&#8230;we have 600 personnel working on &#8230; contact tracing efforts &#8230; At this time, we are achieving our goal by reaching out to 100% of reported cases if they have provided the correct contact information.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the mayors say damage has already been done.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;If there was a better contact tracing program in this county during the height of this pandemic, would we have been in better shape economically?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miami Mayor Francis Suarez: &#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt. There&#8217;s no doubt about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber: &#8220;When we screw this up, people die.&#8221;</p>
<p>7 Investigates also asked the Florida Department of Health if contact tracers not getting any assignments is a prevalent issue. Officials said they&#8217;re said &#8220;not aware of any issues in Miami-Dade&#8221; County.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another twist in a shopping mall&#8217;s quest to <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/investigations/aquarium-with-checkered-past-plans-to-open-in-south-florida-mall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bring a controversial aquarium to South Florida</a>. We have been on this story for more than two years now &#8212; and tonight, an update. Karen Hensel with 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>In 2018, The Galleria Mall announced SeaQuest, an interactive aquarium, would be coming to Fort Lauderdale, but the move to bring the ocean indoors <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/concern-outrage-grow-over-plans-for-seaquest-aquarium-at-galleria-mall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quickly made waves</a>.</p>
<p>Ken Pelton, protester: &#8220;It&#8217;s just a way to promote business at the expense of animals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Animal activists <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/protesters-gather-following-approval-of-seaquest-aquarium-in-fort-lauderdale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protested outside the mall and city hall</a> angry about <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/investigations/seaquest-submits-plans-for-galleria-mall-location-even-as-aquarium-sinks-deeper-into-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">allegations animals were mistreated and died</a> at other SeaQuest locations.</p>
<p>Fort Lauderdale gave the green light last year, <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/investigations/animal-advocates-sue-fort-lauderdale-try-to-sink-controversial-seaquest-aquarium-in-court/">but activists sued to stop it</a>, claiming the city&#8217;s permit approval process was flawed.</p>
<p>Judge: &#8220;We&#8217;re here this afternoon on Campos vs. the City of Fort Lauderdale.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, even as that lawsuit continues, another one has been filed. This time, by the owner of The Galleria Mall.</p>
<p>The same mall that tried to bring SeaQuest in now wants the aquarium out.</p>
<p>The eviction lawsuit accuses SeaQuest of breaching its lease after several companies filed liens claiming they are owed money for work on the project.</p>
<p>Robert Harris, Airmatic Controls: &#8220;It&#8217;s devastating. It makes it very difficult to stay in business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robert Harris owns Airmatic Controls. The Davie company, which has 12 employees, installed cooling and ventilation systems for Seaquest.</p>
<p>Robert Harris: &#8220;They were custom made units to cool and dehumidify the space with the water tanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Karen Hensel: &#8220;And you ended up paying your vendors even though you&#8217;re still owed over $100,000?&#8221;</p>
<p>Robert Harris: &#8220;I made sure that all of my vendors were taken care of, so I&#8217;ve definitely dug a big hole. Not only that, but trying to collect on that money, I&#8217;ve also accumulated additional costs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harris says he&#8217;s still owed $108,000.</p>
<p>SeaQuest was expected to open last year but was delayed.</p>
<p>In a video posted two weeks ago on Facebook, CEO Vince Covino blamed coronavirus for the recent setback.</p>
<p>Vince Covino, CEO: &#8220;We put the exhibits up. We started our theming. We were well into theming. We&#8217;re actually about 85% of the way done, and then, that&#8217;s when COVID hits.&#8221;</p>
<p>But 7 Investigates has found SeaQuest got between $2 and $5 million through the federal government&#8217;s loan program meant to keep small businesses afloat.</p>
<p>In a statement to 7News, Covino said the company &#8220;lost many millions of dollars&#8221; when they had to close down other Seaquest locations due to the pandemic, and the loan money helped cover labor and rent.</p>
<p>As for Fort Lauderdale, Covino said they paid a &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of the subcontractors and have a plan to &#8220;pay all subcontractors in full.&#8221;</p>
<p>Karen Hensel: &#8220;If you had Vince Covino here in front of you, what would you say to him directly?&#8221;</p>
<p>Robert Harris: &#8220;The owner of Seaquest? I would say pay your contractors, so your contractor can pay his vendors and make things right.&#8221;</p>
<p>SeaQuest&#8217;s website still says its Fort Lauderdale location is set to open in late spring or early summer 2020. That time has now passed, and given the pending eviction case, whether it ever opens is in question.</p>
<p>Full statement from SeaQuest CEO Vince Covino to 7News:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;As with most zoos and aquariums, we have lost many millions of dollars due to the pandemic. We had to close down all locations days before our busy spring break and summer season. With over 35,000 animals to feed, the cost is over $55,000 every day. Fortunately, we shored up some of those losses with PPP funds, which covered labor and rent for a few months. Additionally, we have a dozen landlords around the country who have been very understanding and flexible on terms as we navigate these uncharted waters together. They know we will survive and deliver a significant economic impact once we get a vaccine.</em></p>
<p><em>While we are disheartened by immense pressure from Galleria, we are also working hard to come to an agreement wherein we have offered to bring significant cash to the table immediately, and have included a contingency plan to open SeaQuest this year and pay all subcontractors in full.  The vast majority have been paid in full for work performed, and only 6-8 weeks of work remains. We have maintained a skeleton crew on site continually, and they are on site working right now. If we are successful in getting a bit more flexibility from Galleria, we will open a very successful entertainment destination that will inspire over 400,000 guests per year to fall in love with and protect the animals who share their planet with us.&#8221; </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Florida students are learning from home right now, but the goal is to get them safely back into the classroom. Reporter Karen Hensel shows us a classroom coronavirus study every parent will want to see in tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>When it comes to spreading COVID-19, it&#8217;s what you can&#8217;t see that can harm you.</p>
<p>In this research simulation from the University of Minnesota, all of those red drops show the spread of coronavirus from people talking without masks.</p>
<p>The researchers tracked the aerosol droplets in three scenarios: a grocery store, an elevator and a classroom.</p>
<p>Researchers found the location of the ventilation system is a big factor.</p>
<p>In this simulation, the teacher, who does most of the talking, is at the front of the room.</p>
<p>The vent is in the back.</p>
<p>Aerosols exhaled from the teacher quickly spread through the classroom.</p>
<p>Dr. Suo Yang/Assistant Professor, Mechanical Engineering, University of Minnesota: &#8220;To our surprise, only about 10% of the aerosols are being vented out, and the majority of the aerosols are still in the room.&#8221;</p>
<p>Researcher Suo Yang says virus-carrying droplets are left covering walls and desks where they can remain for days.</p>
<p>Dr. Suo Yang: &#8220;So, if your hand touches it, and then, you touch your mouth or nose, then you have basically transferred the virus.&#8221;</p>
<p>This next simulation shows what happens when the ventilation is next to the teacher.</p>
<p>You can see many of the droplets being exhaled are sucked into the system and out of the room.</p>
<p>Dr. Suo Yang: &#8220;Specifically based on our study, I would put ventilation right above the teacher or near the teacher.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yang says the study has prompted more schools to buy air purifiers, which he thinks is a good idea.</p>
<p>Dr. Suo Yang: &#8220;So, there are two functions. One is to try to confine the aerosols near the teacher. Second is to purify the aerosol before it can reach the students.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s better news for your grocery shopping trip.</p>
<p>A simulation was also run on the aisles of a grocery store.</p>
<p>The simulation showed 40% of what is exhaled by the shopper was filtered out of the store.</p>
<p>Yang says the long aisles with shoppers moving and high shelves are a big help in air circulation.</p>
<p>Dr. Suo Yang: &#8220;The shelves actually help improve the ventilation, and we have about half of the aerosols getting out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The third area they tested was inside an elevator. They say if you&#8217;re in here alone, you&#8217;re at a low risk, but if others are inside, they say don&#8217;t talk. By not speaking, you can reduce the number of potentially contaminated aerosols swirling in a small area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a month after a 7News investigation into pandemic parties at Miami condos, one building is taking action. 7&#8217;s Karen Hensel investigates</p>
<p>A DJ playing pulsating music, colorful lights and no social distancing.</p>
<p>The video, posted on Instagram in late July, is not from inside a club but inside a condo unit at Opera Tower in Miami.</p>
<p>Brian Przystup, condo unit owner: &#8220;They&#8217;re still coming in in groups with no masks, with no social distancing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brian Przystup has owned a unit here since the building first opened in 2008, but the mega Miami Heat fan is fired up over what he says has been an ongoing problem.</p>
<p>Some owners are renting their units to a constant stream of guests.</p>
<p>Karen Hensel: &#8220;So did all of this force you to leave?&#8221;</p>
<p>Brian Przystup: &#8220;I stayed in my office a couple of nights on the weekends because the weekends are the worst.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, the Opera Tower Condominium Association is asking a judge to slam the door on short-term rentals.</p>
<p>They are suing Airbnb, claiming the online platform &#8220;misappropriated the condominium property and turned it into its own de facto, unlicensed hotel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Included in the lawsuit is a link to <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/investigations/residents-at-2-miami-condos-fed-up-with-short-term-rentals-pandemic-parties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this 7News report</a> from August.</p>
<p>Resident: &#8220;You kind of feel like you&#8217;re a prisoner in your own building. It&#8217;s kind of insane.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when residents first told us a combination of COVID, loud parties and violence had turned luxury living into a nightmare.</p>
<p>David Ewing, resident: &#8220;We had a shooting here a couple of weeks ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police say <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/several-people-detained-while-police-investigate-shooting-in-miami/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shots were fired</a> inside Opera Tower on June 16 after an argument, but according to the lawsuit, that&#8217;s just one incident.</p>
<p>The association found between 2017 and 2020, there were 397 calls to 911 and &#8220;numerous crimes&#8221; at the building, &#8220;including robberies, assaults and allegations of a rape.&#8221;</p>
<p>They say more than a half million dollars a year is now spent on security.</p>
<p>Brian Przystup: &#8220;Leaving the building and going home at night, I am literally afraid for my life. I carry mace.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month, Airbnb announced a <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-announces-global-party-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">global party ban</a>, and in response to the lawsuit, the company tells 7News: &#8220;All Airbnb users agree to comply with applicable laws and regulations &#8230; and we have shared the Opera Tower Association&#8217;s concerns with members of our host community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Residents have been sharing their concerns with us with videos and pictures of continued condo commotion. From people appearing to sneak in through the garage, to lines in the lobby and busted elevator buttons.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve also taken to social media to document those concerns.</p>
<p>Social Media video: &#8220;It&#8217;s 11:57pm. Opera is going full force. Very little social distancing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brian Przystup: &#8220;I am not going to stop my mission until every short-term rental is out of that building, and we regain our safety, our livelihood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two days after our first story on Opera Tower, this cease and desist letter was posted at the building. It&#8217;s from the City of Miami announcing an investigation into short-term rentals and any violations of city code. The association has also filed lawsuits against two individual unit owners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s an agonizing anniversary in the Bahamas. A memorial has been set up on one of the islands hardest hit by Hurricane Dorian to honor the lives lost.</p>
<p>The Category 5 storm caused death and mass destruction one year ago. Much of the island chain is still struggling to rebuild, a process made that much more difficult by the coronavirus pandemic. Kevin Ozebek has a look in tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>Hurricane Dorian roared into the Bahamas on Sep. 1, taking homes and businesses apart piece by piece.</p>
<p>Bernadette Johnson: “We had winds up to 180 miles an hour.”</p>
<p>More than 70 people died and some are still missing. Memories of the long days after the storm are echoes of a nightmare.</p>
<p>Lance Pinder: “Everything was just a disaster. It was just unbelievable, what it was like.”</p>
<p>This is Grand Bahama Island today. Evidence of Dorian’s wrath is everywhere.</p>
<p>And now, a medical storm called COVID is creating another challenge for people just trying to get their lives back.</p>
<p>Bernadette Johnson: “I started rebuilding. Business opened up back in January.”</p>
<p>Months after Dorian hit, Bernadette Johnson rebuilt her popular restaurant, &#8220;Bernie’s Tiki Hut,&#8221; on Grand Bahama Island. Now, COVID has taken the tourists and her business away.</p>
<p>Bernadette Johnson: “Hotels are closed, no ships coming in, no cruise ships coming in, no jobs, you know. It&#8217;s really bad. I have family in Abaco. I have family in Inaugua. I have family in Eluthera, Andros — everybody&#8217;s singing the same song.”</p>
<p>Many homes here in Freeport, and even the main hospital, are still under repair.</p>
<p>And even now, people have to line up for water.</p>
<p>Katherine Forbes-Smith: “Our main focus has been really debris clean up, housing, temporary, long term.”</p>
<p>Katherine Forbes-Smith of the Bahamas Disaster Reconstruction Authority says the government has spent $30 million on cleanup alone.</p>
<p>Katherine Forbes-Smith: “We&#8217;ve moved about 3 million cubic yards of debris. As far as debris is concerned, we feel like we&#8217;re about 90% where we want to be.”</p>
<p>But on the hard-hit Abaco islands, power is only partially restored. Many remain homeless, and businesses are struggling.</p>
<p>Lance Pinder: “The commercial center hub of the island is still&#8230; I mean, it&#8217;s a wreck. We don&#8217;t have a proper bank here right now. There are still people living in tents. There are still people living with tarps on their roofs.”</p>
<p>Lance Pinder manages Abaco Big Bird Poultry Farm. A year later, the company has only built back two of the five barns lost to Dorian.</p>
<p>Lance Pinder: “If it wasn&#8217;t for the outside organizations from the U.S. and other places around the world that came here and helped us, I don&#8217;t know where we would be.</p>
<p>In Marsh Harbor, the island&#8217;s one medical clinic was destroyed. Now, it&#8217;s operating out of a building intended to be a mortuary.</p>
<p>Dr. George Charite: “Our greatest challenge today is patients who require hospitalization and diagnostic services.”</p>
<p>Dr. Charite treats people with everyday ailments and injuries. He also sees some COVID patients and those with post-traumatic stress from the storm.</p>
<p>Dr. George Charite: “You often find yourself having to console people because they&#8217;re still having that deja vu from the hurricane itself, and it&#8217;s a continuous battle.”</p>
<p>For now, the battle to rebuild continues.</p>
<p>Katherine Forbes-Smith: “People have not been happy with the recovery and the reality is, Dorian, as a Category 5 storm, changed people&#8217;s lives.”</p>
<p>Right now, there is a 14-day COVID quarantine in place for people who want to enter the Bahamas. That&#8217;s enough to discourage many volunteers from traveling in to help, making recovery in the island paradise take that much longer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The pandemic has already turned life upside down for so many, but South Florida high school students who are applying to college are being hit with another obstacle. 7&#8217;s Karen Hensel investigates.</p>
<p>These Miami-Dade high school seniors are dressed for success, but they haven&#8217;t had much success finishing their college applications.</p>
<p>Jose Pujol, high school senior: &#8220;Actually, I go to sleep thinking about this, right? Because it&#8217;s pretty big.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jose Pujol and his friends want to attend one of Florida&#8217;s state universities after graduation, but they haven&#8217;t taken their SATs yet, and they&#8217;re running out of time.</p>
<p>Jose Pujol: &#8220;They&#8217;ve kept cancelling our test dates, and I myself have gotten the test cancelled about five times now, haven&#8217;t been able to take it once.&#8221;</p>
<p>The College Board administers the exam seven times a year, starting in March.</p>
<p>Many high schools double as testing centers, so when they closed because of the coronavirus pandemic, three test dates during the spring were scrapped.</p>
<p>The next date was at the end of August.</p>
<p>Jose Pujol: &#8220;That one also got cancelled.&#8221;</p>
<p>An extra date was added for September, but Jose isn&#8217;t hopeful.</p>
<p>The College Board&#8217;s website lists nearly 60 testing locations across Miami-Dade and Broward counties. More than half of those are closed.</p>
<p>Students are warned to contact the open test centers to make sure testing is actually taking place.</p>
<p>Jose Ibarra, high school senior: &#8220;Once I contacted them, they just told me the same thing, that they were cancelled due to the pandemic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several colleges and universities have waived test requirements for college applicants. The Florida State Board of Governors, which oversees the state&#8217;s university system, has not.</p>
<p>In an email to 7 Investigates, the board says, &#8220;Our office has been working with both test administration entities, and we see that they are placing a high priority on making sure Florida&#8217;s students are able to take these tests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robert Medina, high school senior: &#8220;A lot of students were looking at August as a final hope.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robert Medina managed to take the test before the March shutdown. He wanted to retake it in August to try to raise his score.</p>
<p>He says he can&#8217;t find an open test center in South Florida, so he&#8217;s planning to hit the road.</p>
<p>Robert Medina: &#8220;To Port St. Lucie.&#8221;</p>
<p>But making a long drive up north is not an option for some.</p>
<p>Jose Ibarra: &#8220;I also have a job, so it&#8217;s very difficult to move that around, so being able to take it in this county is very important for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to take the test by the fall semester of their senior year, but with just four test dates left this semester, and South Florida schools closed for in-house learning, the SAT is putting our students to the test in applying for college.</p>
<p>7 Investigates has reached out to the College Board to ask if they plan any additional testing options for South Florida students. As of late Friday night, they have not responded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In South Florida, if you&#8217;re hitting the gym, you don&#8217;t have a choice. Working out with a mask is mandatory, but is it safe? Once again, the Nightteam&#8217;s Kevin Ozebek with tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>These are trying times, but doctors say being fit is more important than ever.</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Rosselli, orthopedic: &#8220;Working out does improve your immune response to fighting disease, so it is something we should be doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>But working out with a mask on is a huge adjustment.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;You almost feel like you&#8217;re drowning in that.&#8221;</p>
<p>And for some, it could be risky.</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Rosselli: &#8220;It can be quite dangerous if you don&#8217;t listen to your body.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Rosselli is with South Miami Walk-in Orthopedics and Sports Medicine.</p>
<p>He had me up bright and early&#8230;</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;That woke me up!&#8221;</p>
<p>To see how working out with a mask impacts the body.</p>
<p>I did one minute each of a slow walk, power walk and then a full-on sprint without a mask.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;I thought that would be easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a rest, I repeated the same exercises with a mask.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;Even at this light pace, it&#8217;s a little bit harder to breathe.&#8221;</p>
<p>I started with a resting heart rate of 65 beats per minute.</p>
<p>After the quick walk without a mask, my heart rate ticked up just slightly to 70 beats per minute, but after the one minute walk with the mask&#8230;</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;It almost feels like my body is craving oxygen.&#8221;</p>
<p>My heart rate was 96 beats per minute.</p>
<p>The power walk with no mask made my heart beat at just 70 beats per minute.</p>
<p>Repeated with the mask&#8230;</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;I almost feel like I am out of breath now.&#8221;</p>
<p>It jumped to 102 beats per minute.</p>
<p>For the all-out run, even without the mask, I measured 133 beats per minute, but with the mask, my breathing became heavy, and my heart rate skyrocketed up to 152 beats per minute.</p>
<p>Dr. Rosselli says with the mask, it&#8217;s easier for your heart rate to climb into the danger zone.</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Rosselli: &#8220;When you&#8217;re at that higher heart rate, you feel that shortness of breath, you feel light-headed, you feel dizzy, you feel that maybe you don&#8217;t have the same balance you would have had without the mask.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Stephen Noel Henry with the University of Miami says those with preexisting conditions need to be especially careful.</p>
<p>Dr. Stephen Noel Henry, Sports Medicine physician: &#8220;The minute you put that mask on and you start to feel short of breath, start to feel dizzy, especially when you&#8217;re exercising, you start to have any chest pain, that&#8217;s your cue to back off intensity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Working out increases your blood pressure. Add a mask into the mix, and it climbs faster.</p>
<p>After a quick lap and a circuit of Russian twists, jump rope, bicep curls and battle ropes&#8230;</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;I want to rip this mask off!&#8221;</p>
<p>My blood pressure went from 125 over 79 to 149 over 95.</p>
<p>Dr. Stephen Noel Henry: &#8220;And you&#8217;re healthy, so imagine someone with an underlying heart condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Perez: &#8220;What number?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;About a six now.&#8221;</p>
<p>UM&#8217;s Dr. Noris Perez says since there are no heart monitors at most gyms, rate your exertion level from zero to 10 while working out with a mask.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;OK, now I am winded. Now, I am about a seven. I don&#8217;t think I could have a full conversation with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Noris Perez: &#8220;So you&#8217;re more like an eight. This is where I would stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you push your body all the way to the max, you could overheat or get lightheaded.</p>
<p>Dr. Noris Perez, physical therapist: &#8220;It&#8217;s not going to be the same. Because we have this added restriction, we should just be more cautious. Whatever level you had before, think about where it was and just go down a notch. That&#8217;s the safest thing you can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Make no mistake, these doctors say if you&#8217;re working out at a gym or near others, it&#8217;s crucial you wear a mask.</p>
<p>So, for very high intensity workouts, they say it&#8217;s not a bad idea to try them at home where you can take the mask off.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Across the state, nearly 3,800 residents and staff of nursing homes and assisted living facilities have died from COVID-19. 7&#8217;s Kevin Ozebek investigates why that death toll is so high.</p>
<p>For Carmen Marin, the pandemic took away a man who, to her, was more than just her sister&#8217;s husband.</p>
<p>Carmen Marin: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t lose a brother-in-law. I lost a brother.”</p>
<p>On May 1, Jose Garcia died after contracting COVID-19.</p>
<p>Carmen Marin: &#8220;He was married to my sister for 51 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jose tested positive for the virus while he was a resident at the Fair Havens Center nursing home in Miami Springs.</p>
<p>Carmen Marin: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think they realize the harm and the pain they have caused to so many families.&#8221;</p>
<p>To date, 54 residents of Fair Havens Center have died from the coronavirus. That&#8217;s the second-highest COVID death toll at a long-term care facility in the state.</p>
<p>One week after Jose died, the state ordered Fair Havens to stop admitting new residents.</p>
<p>Inspectors found an occupational therapist &#8220;in the COVID-19 isolation area not wearing full PPE&#8221; and after a reshuffling of room assignments, &#8220;at least 15 COVID negative residents were exposed to COVID-19.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brian Lee: &#8220;I think nursing homes have to do a better job at keeping our loved ones safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brian Lee advocates for nursing home residents through the non-profit Families for Better Care.</p>
<p>Brian Lee: &#8220;So they&#8217;ve put down the clamps to have no more admissions but at the same time you have those folks inside the facility that could be potentially exposed to COVID.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: “What should the state have done in your eyes?”</p>
<p>Carmen Marin: “Should have closed the place.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Fair Havens remains open, the state has closed six small assisted living facilities in South Florida. Some of their inspection reports are even more startling.</p>
<p>At Freire and Sotomayor assisted living facility in Southwest Miami-Dade, state inspectors noted &#8220;the COVID-19 positive residents were not quarantined during the survey visit.&#8221;</p>
<p>At South Florida Home Services in Miami, &#8220;a staff member who tested positive for COVID-19 remained on active duty caring for residents.&#8221;</p>
<p>At Salmos 23 V in Hialeah, &#8220;a staff member who had tested positive was on site. The staff member wore no personal protective equipment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brian Lee: &#8220;It&#8217;s baffling. It is horrific.”</p>
<p>At Sara Home Care in Homestead, &#8220;no residents wore face masks.&#8221;</p>
<p>And at Villa Serena I in Miami, where 14 of the 15 residents tested positive, inspectors found &#8220;no gowns, facial shields, or N-95 masks&#8221; for staff.</p>
<p>At Villa Serena II, also in Miami, &#8220;positive and negative residents were observed interacting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now there are calls for Florida’s Agency for Health Care Administration, or AHCA, to inspect these facilities more frequently.</p>
<p>Brian Lee: &#8220;AHCA has limited its inspection activities to kinda focus on COVID support to facilities, so you&#8217;re not seeing the normal inspections happening at the frequency you did, so oversight has definitely softened and weakened through this crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carmen also places blame on AHCA for her loss.</p>
<p>Carmen Marin: “I&#8217;m still mad.”</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: “Mad at who?”</p>
<p>Carmen Marin: “Fair Haven, the State of Florida.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Fair Havens&#8230;</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: “We&#8217;re wondering who we can speak to about this state report against Fair Havens.&#8221;</p>
<p>At Ventura Services, the nursing home&#8217;s owner answered the door, but two more doorbell rings and 15 minutes of waiting later&#8230;</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: “I think it is safe to say they aren&#8217;t answering.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one came to answer our questions.</p>
<p>On the City of Miami Springs website, we did find this statement from Ventura Services saying during the pandemic it has &#8220;set the gold standard in testing and properly caring for our residents, unlike many other institutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carmen Marin: &#8220;I think that is ridiculous.”</p>
<p>Hardly what Carmen wants to hear, as she still mourns the loss of her beloved brother-in-law.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, 7News received a statement from Shapiro Consulting Group on behalf of Fair Havens Center Nursing Home that read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px">“In May of 2020, the State of Florida mandated that Fair Havens transfer COVID positive patients – those who symptomatic as well as those who were asymptomatic – to area hospitals. Prior to this mandate our in-facility safety protocols maintained a very high survival rate with very few deaths. Our deepest sympathies are with our resident families who have suffered a loss. In accordance with the evolving DOH and CDC guidelines, our employees have been trained, and retrained, and have had all necessary PPE at all times. We appreciate all the hard work and dedication of our employees throughout this difficult and unprecedented pandemic. Currently, we maintain strict testing protocols for all people from the outside coming into the facility, and continue to work with the Department of Health and an infection control consultant, to ensure the health and safety of all residents and employees moving forward.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Miami man is facing a felony charge of animal cruelty. Police say he was buying and selling dogs using online ads. Karen Hensel has tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>Meet Frida, a 12-week-old Chihuahua mix who had just found her forever home.</p>
<p>It was May, and the isolation of the coronavirus pandemic had set in.</p>
<p>Diana Reed&#8217;s 14-year-old dog had died in February, and she was ready for a new companion.</p>
<p>She found Frida on Craigslist for sale for $850. Reed says she thought she was helping a local family during tough times.</p>
<p>Diana Reed, bought sick puppy: &#8220;In the course of the conversation, you know, he&#8217;s telling me exactly what I wanted to hear: he&#8217;s a young father with a young son. He and his wife were both out of work, and that the pandemic had really been hard on them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The seller put what Reed thought was the state required veterinary certificate in her car.</p>
<p>She would not look at it until later.</p>
<p>Diana Reed: &#8220;To be able to hand a family maybe a month&#8217;s rent or a few weeks of groceries by paying for a puppy that they can&#8217;t take care of, it felt really good. I really felt like I was helping someone.&#8221;</p>
<p>But within just two days, the help turned to hurt.</p>
<p>Diana Reed: &#8220;She started having diarrhea and throwing up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reed rushed Frida to two different animal hospitals.</p>
<p>Diana Reed: &#8220;I knew something was horribly wrong, so I took her to Hollywood, where she tested positive for parvo. I never saw her again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parvo is a highly contagious and often deadly virus in dogs.</p>
<p>Reed racked up more than $4,000 in vet bills trying to save Frida, but the dog died.</p>
<p>And remember that vet vaccination record?</p>
<p>Diana Reed: &#8220;It&#8217;s just a couple of stickers on the back of some sort of car receipt.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, she called North Bay Village Police.</p>
<p>This detective works undercover, so we&#8217;re not showing his face.</p>
<p>North Bay Village Police detective: &#8220;He admitted again through the interview process that this dog was not taken to a veterinarian. He&#8217;s definitely not new at this.&#8221;</p>
<p>He is Jesualdo Rangel-Castillo.</p>
<p>The 54-year-old accused puppy peddler was arrested Tuesday, charged with felony animal cruelty and selling an unfit animal without a valid vet certificate.</p>
<p>According to the arrest report, &#8220;Frida was not adequately or properly vaccinated, which reflects directly on the neglect and direct disregard exhibited&#8221; by Rangel-Castillo.</p>
<p>Police say Frida was not the only dog he had for sale.</p>
<p>North Bay Village detective: &#8220;This individual had close to about 135 ads online. That tells me that we might have a lot more victims than we know about.&#8221;</p>
<p>7News obtained additional records by the state agency that regulates animal sales.</p>
<p>Investigators say Rangel-Castillo sold a Maltese for $2,400. He, too, died within days.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also Archer, a Yorkshire terrier, sold for $1,000. The puppy developed pneumonia and spent three weeks in an oxygen tent.</p>
<p>His owner, a CEO of a local company, says it took $15,000 in veterinary care to save Archer&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>While he would not talk on camera, he told us, &#8220;This guy needs to be stopped.&#8221;</p>
<p>North Bay Village detective: &#8220;You&#8217;re buying a dog on the street, and then you&#8217;re flipping this dog for a profit.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Reed, it has been a hard lesson in love and loss.</p>
<p>Diana Reed: &#8220;Aside from feeling immensely sad and heartbroken, I feel stupid.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Diana feels that way because she deals with scams and rip-offs every day as part of her job.</p>
<p>She is an employee here at 7News in the investigative unit.</p>
<p>Diana Reed: &#8220;I&#8217;m an investigative journalist, and if one of my friends told me they were going to do what I did, I would have stopped them, but I didn&#8217;t stop myself. I didn&#8217;t stop to think. I didn&#8217;t investigate him.&#8221;</p>
<p>But now police are investigating Jesualdo Rangel-Castillo. If you bought a sick puppy from him, or know someone who has, police say contact <a href="https://www.miamidade.gov/global/service.page?Mduid_service=ser1481578071427477" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miami-Dade Animal Services</a> or the <a href="https://www.fdacs.gov/Consumer-Resources/Animals/Pet-Law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One South Florida family says their city is trying to sink their summertime fun in the swimming pool. What&#8217;s behind the backyard battle? The Nightteam&#8217;s Karen Hensel has tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>Finding socially distanced activities is a challenge in the age of coronavirus, especially when you have children.</p>
<p>Laymis Alvarez, homeowner: &#8220;Even if the beaches are open, I don&#8217;t want to go because I don&#8217;t want my daughter to get sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s why Laymis Alvarez, a clinical research coordinator who has been working during the pandemic, is glad she has the above ground pool for her 7-year-old daughter to enjoy.</p>
<p>Laymis Alvarez: &#8220;For me, the pool was like relief. Like, &#8216;Wow, thank God that I have a pool,&#8217; and I can go and sit down in the backyard, see my daughter, have a little bit of fun. I&#8217;ve been living in Miami Shores for 10 years. I had the pool already for a year. I&#8217;ve never had a problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>No problems until June, when she got a violation notice from the Miami Shores Code Compliance office.</p>
<p>It stated she needed to remove the 18-foot pool because it was &#8220;not of approved materials.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laymis Alvarez: &#8220;If I don&#8217;t remove the pool, they are going to put a fine for each day that I have the pool.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miami Shores says Laymis violated a section of the construction code that says: &#8220;All buildings and structures shall be constructed of materials approved under the Florida Building Code.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laymis&#8217; argument: what construction?</p>
<p>She assembled her store-bought pool from a box.</p>
<p>Laymis Alvarez: &#8220;It&#8217;s something like I did construction or something in the backyard &#8212; like a structure. Nothing to do with a pool.&#8221;</p>
<p>And look what we found as we drove through Miami Shores: playground equipment, sheds, even a few other small pools.</p>
<p>We asked Miami Shores for copies of violations issued to any other residents for above-ground pools over the last five years.</p>
<p>There was just one other case, in 2017, for an above ground pool &#8220;not made of cement.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Laymis&#8217; pool, the village tells 7News it started with an &#8220;anonymous neighbor complaint.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laymis Alvarez: &#8220;I have a fence around my house, so nobody is in danger. Why? Why are they making it so hard?&#8221;</p>
<p>Laymis is not giving up in this backyard battle. She&#8217;s not removing the pool, and she plans to fight the village&#8217;s violation notice at an upcoming hearing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Florida is struggling through the coronavirus, but there&#8217;s a second public health crisis here you may not know about. The Nightteam&#8217;s Kevin Ozebek takes us to the Keys in tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a tiny mosquito, but a disease it carries can cause immeasurable pain.</p>
<p>Jennifer Jones, dengue fever survivor: &#8220;I&#8217;ve given birth to three children, and this is one of the absolute worst things I have ever experienced.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;Is this hell on Earth?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennifer Jones: &#8220;It is hell on Earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the morning of July 4, Jennifer Jones started cleaning her Tavernier home.</p>
<p>Jennifer Jones: &#8220;I was dusting. I got light headed, thought maybe I stirred up too much dust. Twenty minutes later, I couldn&#8217;t walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the next few days, a rash developed, and Jennifer had crippling headaches and joint pain.</p>
<p>Jennifer Jones: &#8220;What it felt like was, I was instantly a 99-year-old woman who just got hit by a truck. It literally feels like your eyeballs are being ripped from your head.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leonardo Bello of Key Largo experienced similar symptoms.</p>
<p>Leonardo Bello, dengue fever survivor: &#8220;I felt like an old man in my 90s that fell and struggled to get up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;At first, what did you think was happening to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Leonardo Bello: &#8220;I thought I had COVID.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the pain became excruciating, he went to the emergency room.</p>
<p>Leonardo Bello: &#8220;I got to the point where I could barely walk. Your feet start peeling, like skin falling off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both Leonardo and Jennifer ended up testing positive for dengue fever.</p>
<p>Here in the Upper Keys, homeowners have been told to be on alert.</p>
<p>So far, there have been 26 confirmed cases of dengue as Monroe County sees its first outbreak in 10 years.</p>
<p>Chad Huff, Monroe County Mosquito Control: &#8220;If you had an army to send into battle, our inspectors are our frontline.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mosquito control inspectors are now going door-to-door between mile markers 98 and 106.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re looking for larvae of aedes aegypti.</p>
<p>This invasive mosquito with a trademark black and white pattern can spread a host of diseases &#8212; dengue being just one of them.</p>
<p>Chad Huff: &#8220;It&#8217;s a mess of a mosquito, so it is certainly one we&#8217;d rather not have out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Standing water attracts mosquitoes, so residents are being warned not to let water collect in things like pots, fountains and bromeliads.</p>
<p>Dr. Mark Whiteside, Florida Department of Health: &#8220;The COVID thing has really complicated this. That has been on everybody&#8217;s mind, and dengue has been off the radar screen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Mark Whiteside with the Florida Department of Health says the last dengue outbreak a decade ago lasted roughly seven months, so the case count will likely still climb. In May, there was one case of dengue reported in Miami-Dade County, but Whiteside says that case was unrelated to the outbreak in the Keys.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;Do you think this is going to spread down into the Lower Keys potentially and further north into Miami-Dade County?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Mark Whiteside: &#8220;I am hoping and expecting that it would remain confined mainly in the Key Largo area, but as they say, &#8216;Never say never.'&#8221;</p>
<p>So, from Key West to northern Broward County, we&#8217;re all being urged to walk through our properties and empty anything holding standing water. Just one ounce of water is all aedes aegypti needs to lay hundreds of eggs.</p>
<p>Leonardo Bello: &#8220;It attacked my liver, and my white blood count was tanking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because, take it from these two, dengue fever is the last thing you want.</p>
<p>Jennifer Jones: &#8220;This is a very, very nasty disease.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennifer&#8217;s teenage son Josh also started showing symptoms with this head-to-toe rash. He just tested positive.</p>
<p>Jennifer Jones: &#8220;This is a seven-and-a-half square mile neighborhood back here full of kids, and I&#8217;m watching a 16-year-old just suffering. It would kill me if little 3 and 4-year-old kids were out there getting it.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s in all of our interest to take the bite out of this mosquito.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have exposed Miami-Dade mansions being used as party houses during the coronavirus pandemic, but tonight it&#8217;s condo residents complaining, saying a combination of COVID parties and violence has turned luxury living into a nightmare. The Nightteam&#8217;s Karen Hensel investigates.</p>
<p>With stunning views of Biscayne Bay and the downtown Miami skyline, the Opera Tower Condominium looks like a gorgeous place to live.</p>
<p>Spectacular from the outside, but inside the high-rise, some residents say is condo chaos.</p>
<p>Resident: &#8220;In a building that sort of touts itself as luxury, it&#8217;s anything but.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fearing for his safety, this Opera Tower resident asked we not show his face.</p>
<p>Resident: &#8220;You kind of feel like you&#8217;re a prisoner in your own building. It&#8217;s kind of insane.&#8221;</p>
<p>With bars and clubs closed, pandemic parties have moved underground in South Florida.</p>
<p>Resident (in video of 2 a.m. party, July 25): &#8220;I am going to call the police.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parties are happening all night, and look at this: elevator buttons smashed in and a broken bottle of liquor inside.</p>
<p>All of this creates long wait times for the elevators.</p>
<p>Resident: &#8220;There were times when you had to wait in line like you&#8217;re at a theme park, 30 minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police dispatch logs show more than 100 calls to Opera Tower between March and the end of July.</p>
<p>Complaints about everything from loud parties and music to intoxicated people, and a caller who reported a pair throwing rocks from the 21st or 23rd floor balcony.</p>
<p>There was even a porn video shot outside on an Opera Tower balcony.</p>
<p>It has 1.3 million views.</p>
<p>Cellphone video, June 16: &#8220;Oh, my God, so there was a shooting.&#8221;</p>
<p>And in June, Miami Police say <a href="http://wsvn.com/news/local/several-people-detained-while-police-investigate-shooting-in-miami/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shots were fired at Opera Tower</a> after yet another elevator argument.</p>
<p>David Ewing, resident: &#8220;We had a shooting here a couple of weeks ago, and I was out of my apartment for six hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>David Ewing has rented a unit here for five years.</p>
<p>David Ewing: &#8220;I have a beautiful view unit. It has a great city view.&#8221;</p>
<p>A beautiful view, but&#8230;</p>
<p>Karen Hensel: &#8220;Oh, there it is again.&#8221;</p>
<p>David Ewing: &#8220;That&#8217;s the fire alarm going off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daily drama has the former firefighter planning to move out.</p>
<p>David Ewing: &#8220;I need to do it for my own peace of mind and my own security.&#8221;</p>
<p>Residents say a lot of the problems at Opera Tower are because of short-term renters, those who come here to party for the weekend. They say it&#8217;s turned this condo building into a hotel.</p>
<p>Resident: &#8220;The way they go around even having to come to the lobby is that folks will come to these lock boxes.&#8221;</p>
<p>We spotted the lock boxes ourselves on a construction fence directly across the street from the building.</p>
<p>Inside are key fobs needed to enter the building and to avoid registering as required.</p>
<p>Pictures from the lobby show long lines of people with luggage, and Opera Tower is not alone.</p>
<p>Christina Lardon, condo owner, resident: &#8220;It&#8217;s disgusting.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the Club at Brickell Bay, residents have taken pictures of cigarette butts, marijuana, even a condom landing on their balconies.</p>
<p>Christina Lardon lives here, and so does her daughter.</p>
<p>Christina Lardon: &#8220;She&#8217;s finding used condoms, blunts, feces from animals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Disturbance calls fill police logs here, too, from loud music and parties to face mask violations and short-term rental complaints.</p>
<p>Lardon says she regularly asks renters to wear masks because the rule isn&#8217;t being enforced.</p>
<p>Christina Lardon: &#8220;They get confrontational in the elevator. I had somebody threaten me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She recently called Miami code compliance.</p>
<p>Christina Lardon: &#8220;She was too afraid to step into the building. She said she didn&#8217;t feel comfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Karen Hensel: &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>Christina Lardon: &#8220;Because she saw people weren&#8217;t wearing masks. They weren&#8217;t social distancing.&#8221;</p>
<p>7News reached out to both condo associations.</p>
<p>We did not hear back from the Club at Brickell Bay, but the attorney for Opera Tower told us the association is &#8220;actively seeking to terminate all short-term rental activities&#8221; and has &#8220;sent cease and desist letters to unit owners and/or renters,&#8221; but since he says not all have stopped, there could be further action.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Masks have become a daily part of our lives. People wear all kinds, from surgical masks to fashion forward face coverings, but which ones offer the best protection from the coronavirus? In tonight&#8217;s 7 Investigates, 7&#8217;s Kevin Ozebek puts several popular masks to the test.</p>
<p>As COVID cases surge in South Florida, the mandate is clear: masks are a must, but are all of these different masks created equal?</p>
<p>To find out, we went inside the lab of Dr. Nwadiuto Esiobu.</p>
<p>Dr. Nwadiuto Esiobu, microbiologist, Florida Atlantic University: &#8220;When you kiss someone, you&#8217;re actually signing up to swap germs.&#8221;</p>
<p>She&#8217;s a microbiologist, with a sense of humor, at Florida Atlantic University.</p>
<p>She set up an experiment to see what mask most effectively blocks the tiny droplets we expel when we talk, sneeze, and of course, cough.</p>
<p>Dr. Nwadiuto Esiobu: &#8220;When you speak, you release droplets. Those droplets are microbe-laden, many bacteria, a lot of viruses, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The guinea pigs in this experiment: Dr. Esiobu, one of her students and me.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;OK, so this first one is going to be no covering of my face or mouth, so we&#8217;re just going to cough on the petri dish, so let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>
<p>First we coughed without a mask right into a petri dish, and then coughed into a separate petri dish six inches away to see if distance matters.</p>
<p>Next, we all coughed through four different types of masks.</p>
<p>The KN-95 is a thick mask with five layers.</p>
<p>The surgical mask is lighter weight with three layers.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;Here we go.&#8221; (coughs)</p>
<p>The neck gaiter is thin, almost see-through.</p>
<p>Dr. Nwadiuto Esiobu: &#8220;I can see you very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s easy to pull on and off.</p>
<p>We also tested a double-layer homemade mask without a filter.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;A lot riding on this one: hand-sewn by our photographer&#8217;s fiancee. Here we go, five final coughs.&#8221;</p>
<p>To find out which mask keeps the most droplets in, the petri dishes have to incubate over the weekend.</p>
<p>We did the test on a Friday and came back on a Monday.</p>
<p>Dr. Nwadiuto Esiobu: &#8220;So the results are in. First, we found out that without the mask, you have a whole lot of growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is one of the petri dishes we coughed right on without a mask. Look at all the bacteria!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the kind of germ transfer you can expect in close quarters.</p>
<p>Dr. Nwadiuto Esiobu: &#8220;This is likely what would happen if you&#8217;re at the bar. You are looking at bacterial colonies.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a lot less bacteria in the petri dishes we coughed on while we were six inches away.</p>
<p>Kevin Ozebek: &#8220;What does this tell us about social distancing?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Nwadiuto Esiobu: &#8220;It works.&#8221;</p>
<p>But check out the petri dishes we coughed on while we were wearing the KN-95 masks. They looked good as new.</p>
<p>Dr. Nwadiuto Esiobu: &#8220;Each time with this experiment, we find that 100% of the time, we got no aerosols passed through the KN-95s.&#8221;</p>
<p>When we used surgical masks, the petri dishes also grew no bacteria.</p>
<p>As for those cloth masks, homemade by Milvian, our photographer&#8217;s fiancee, they worked, too.</p>
<p>Dr. Nwadiuto Esiobu: &#8220;Absolutely no growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The neck gaiter didn&#8217;t do as well.</p>
<p>You can see on one of the petri dishes there&#8217;s a bacteria colony, but even the gaiter blocks a large amount of potentially dangerous drops.</p>
<p>The bottom line: masks work.</p>
<p>Dr. Nwadiuto Esiobu: &#8220;Let&#8217;s take the politics out of this, and whenever it is necessary, wear the mask.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can do your own mask test right at home. Dr. Esiobu says, if you can see light through your mask, it&#8217;s too thin, or if you can blow a candle out while wearing it, you probably need a thicker one.</p>
