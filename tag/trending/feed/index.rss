										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(CNN) &#8212; Four elderly sisters in New Jersey haven&#8217;t been able to have their regular get-togethers during the coronavirus pandemic, but they made an exception to get their Covid-19 vaccinations.</p>
<p>Edith Camp, 96, Bernice Cecil, 92, Nora McDonald, 86, and 84-year-old Rose Ramsey &#8212; got their second doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Tuesday at Inspira Medical Center Mullica Hill, south of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>It was Cecil&#8217;s idea for them to get their shots together, according to Ramsey&#8217;s daughter Lori Goldsmid.</p>
<p>It &#8220;was my aunt Bernice&#8217;s idea to have them together, you know, for a little bit of support for each other because it&#8217;s scary,&#8221; Goldsmid told CNN.</p>
<p>It took some doing, but Goldsmid was able to arrange for them all to get their first dose at the same time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was glad and relieved to get it over with and I wasn&#8217;t nervous at all,&#8221; Ramsey told Goldsmid.</p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t get much of a chance to talk on Tuesday because of all the media attention, but they agreed that the staff was all very nice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe so many people care about four old ladies getting their shots,&#8221; Camp said to her niece.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, the five sisters saw each other regularly and they would all have lunch at least once a month.</p>
<p>Goldsmid said they&#8217;re excited to see each other in about 10-14 days once the vaccine has been in their systems long enough to give them the most protection.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re already trying to make plans at this point, whether we&#8217;re going to do it at someone&#8217;s house or see if we can get a room at a restaurant for lunch,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve been able to talk on the phone and on FaceTime, but they haven&#8217;t been able to get together or see other members of their large family since February of last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the hardest part for some of them was not seeing their grandchildren at the same time as not being able to see their sisters,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s heartbreaking at that age not to be able to see any of your family.&#8221;</p>
<p>Goldsmid said the five sisters have more than 100 grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren between them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SINGER ISLAND, Fla. (WSVN) &#8212; A beautiful view of a school of sharks was caught on camera earlier this week.</p>
<p>Photographer Paul Dabill captured stunning drone video of a school of hundreds of blacktip sharks swimming off the coast of Singer Island, Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dabill posted the video to Facebook.</p>
<div class="fb-post" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/PaulDabillPhotography/posts/3884058041671535" data-width="552"></div>
<p>Some of the sharks could be seen jumping out of the water and doing twirls in the air.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://myfwc.com/wildlifehabitats/profiles/saltwater/sharks/blacktip-shark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Florida Fish and Wildlife</a>, large schools will often form during annual migration times. The sharks will go southward and into deeper coastal waters during the winter months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) &#8212; A Texas school district has removed an assignment that called for girls to follow the &#8220;Rules of Chivalry,&#8221; including dressing &#8220;in a feminine manner to please men&#8221; and to &#8220;not complain or whine.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.everythinglubbock.com/news/local-news/chivalry-homework-assignments-gains-negative-attention-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KLBK-TV</a>, the assignment was to be completed this week by students at Shallowater High School and was shared in a private Facebook group. The assignment sparked online criticism of the district.</p>
<p>According to an image of the assignment, it was intended to &#8220;demonstrate to the school how the code of chivalry and standards set in the medieval concept of courtly love carries over into the modern day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The instructions said &#8220;ladies deemed worthy of the honor by the gentlemen&#8221; would receive 10 points for every signature they received as they completed each task. The tasks also included cooking for the boys in their class, walking &#8220;behind men daintily as if their feet were bound,&#8221; cleaning up after the boys and outside of the classroom, not &#8220;show intellectual superiority if it would offend the men around them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shallowater Independent School District did not immediately respond to calls from The Associated Press for comment.</p>
<p>In a statement to the station, the school district said the assignment had been reviewed and &#8220;despite its historical context, it does not reflect our district and community values.&#8221; The assignment was addressed with the teacher and removed, according to the district&#8217;s statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Officials say a teen who was kidnapped by her father in 2019 is potentially being held in Florida.</p>
<p>According to the Hamilton County District Attorney&#8217;s Office in Tennessee, 17-year-old Daphne Westbrook was kidnapped by her father, John Oliver Westbrook in Oct. 2019.</p>
<p>Officials said she never came back after a weekend visit with her father in Chattanooga. Her dogs, Fern and Strawberry, were also missing.</p>
<figure id="attachment_876789" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-876789" style="width: 932px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://wsvn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/westbrook-dogs.jpg?quality=60&amp;strip=color"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-876789" src="https://wsvn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/westbrook-dogs.jpg?quality=60&amp;strip=color" alt="" width="932" height="524" srcset="https://wsvn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/westbrook-dogs.jpg 932w, https://wsvn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/westbrook-dogs.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://wsvn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/westbrook-dogs.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://wsvn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/westbrook-dogs.jpg?resize=775,435 775w" sizes="(max-width: 932px) 100vw, 932px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-876789" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy: Hamilton County District Attorney&#8217;s Office</figcaption></figure>
<p>&#8220;We believe Daphne is being held against her will, unable to communicate with the outside world,&#8221; the district attorney&#8217;s office said. &#8220;Our investigation shows she is endangered both physically and mentally, and is routinely being drugged and/or kept drunk to incapacitate her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Officials said John Westbrook is an &#8220;IT expert specializing in security, block chain technology, and bitcoin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is communicating in a way that’s almost impossible to trace, which makes it extremely difficult for investigators to generate significant leads in this case,&#8221; officials said in a statement. &#8220;We know he is earning money contracting with small businesses to do computer security work.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fox13news.com/news/tennessee-teen-kidnapped-by-father-in-2019-may-be-in-tampa-officials-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox 13 reports</a> that officials believe John Westbrook may have sought shelter with a relative near Tampa, possibly his sister Starla Westbrook who lives in Sebring.</p>
<p>Officials said Starla is refusing to cooperate with investigators and recently worked at a Ross store. They also added that she uses the name Sharlena Peters on Facebook and YouTube.</p>
<p>Hamilton County authorities said John may have altered his appearance, along with Daphne&#8217;s, and might be using hair dye and fake teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daphne has not been allowed to attend school or visit a doctor and is being deprived of medication,&#8221; authorities added. &#8220;She is in increasingly at serious risk of physical and emotional danger and we need your help to find her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anyone who may have spotted Daphne, John or her dogs is asked to call the Hamilton County District Attorney&#8217;s Office at 1-423-209-7425. Tips can also be submitted to FindingDaphne@hcdatn.org.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(CNN) &#8212; Jeep&#8217;s new boss says the company is open to dropping the name &#8220;Cherokee&#8221; from its vehicles in response to objections from the Cherokee Nation.</p>
<p>The company is engaged in talks with officials from the Native American tribe, according to Carlos Tavares, CEO of Stellantis, the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2021/01/04/cars/fiat-chrysler-psa-merger-approval/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently merged automaker</a> that includes the Jeep brand. Tavares made the comment in an interview with the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jeep-owner-stellantis-is-open-to-dropping-cherokee-name-ceo-says-11614799301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal</a> and his comments were confirmed by the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are ready to go to any point, up to the point where we decide with the appropriate people and with no intermediaries,&#8221; he said when asked about dropping the name. &#8220;At this stage, I don&#8217;t know if there is a real problem. But if there is one, well, of course we will solve it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/us-world/chief-of-cherokee-nation-asks-jeep-to-stop-using-tribes-name/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">objections to the name</a> were raised by Chuck Hoskin Jr., principal chief of the Cherokee Nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;re in a day and age in this country where it&#8217;s time for both corporations and team sports to retire the use of Native American names, images and mascots from their products, team jerseys and sports in general,&#8221; he said in a statement last month.</p>
<p>The Grand Cherokee is one of the best-selling models any of Stellantis&#8217; brands in terms of global sales. It is No. 2 in the company&#8217;s US sales, behind only the Ram pickup, and the Cherokee is No. 4 in US sales. The Cherokee name was first used on a Jeep SUV in 1974, and has been in use by Jeep on either the Cherokee or Grand Cherokee ever since.</p>
<p>The discussion around the Cherokee name comes as many sports teams and companies are rethinking logos that rely on racist or stereotypical representations of minorities.</p>
<p>The Washington Football team last summer dropped its &#8220;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2020/07/13/us/washington-redskins-nickname-change-spt/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redskins</a>&#8221; name, and the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/13/us/cleveland-indians-mlb-name-change-spt-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cleveland Indians baseball team</a> followed suit a few months later. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/17/us/landolakes-logo-change-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Land O&#8217; Lakes</a> butter last year removed an image of a Native American woman from its label. Other food brands including &#8220;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2021/02/09/business/aunt-jemima-new-name/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aunt Jemima</a>,&#8221; have also begun rebranding amid a national reckoning over institutional racism.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>(CNN) &#x2014; Twitter is working on a feature that could<strong>&#xC2;&#xA0;</strong>offer users a short window of time to rethink<strong>&#xC2;&#xA0;</strong>posting a tweet even after they hit send.<p>The company confirmed to CNN Business on Friday it is testing an undo option that would potentially let users retract or correct a<strong>&#xC2;&#xA0;</strong>tweet before it&#x2019;s officially posted on the platform.</p><p>The feature was discovered by Jane Manchun<strong>&#xC2;&#xA0;</strong>Wong, an app developer who has a&#xC2;&#xA0;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/22/tech/jane-wong-app-features/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong track record</a>&#xC2;&#xA0;of uncovering new tools on social networks before they&#x2019;re released. Wong posted&#xC2;&#xA0;<a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1367704041942179841" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a GIF</a>&#xC2;&#xA0;on Twitter that shows a blue &#x201C;undo&#x201D; bar appearing beneath the words &#x201C;Your Tweet was sent.&#x201D; (It&#x2019;s possible the feature could change before it formally rolls out &#x2014; if it ever does.)</p><div><embed type="oembed">https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1367704041942179841</embed></div><p>It&#x2019;s not quite&#xC2;&#xA0;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066815/twitter-edit-button-jack-dorsey-says-no" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the edit button</a>&#xC2;&#xA0;users have long requested, but it&#x2019;s a step toward helping users<strong>&#xC2;&#xA0;</strong>proactively catch errors and slow down before sending impulse tweets.</p><p>The feature is reminiscent of Gmail&#x2019;s existing&#xC2;&#xA0;<a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/2819488?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recall tool</a>, which allows users up to 30 seconds to retract sending<strong>&#xC2;&#xA0;</strong>an email.</p><p>Last year, Twitter told investors it was mulling a subscription service and was evaluating exclusive options for paying users, including an &#x201C;undo send&#x201D; feature. At the time, the company said it&#xC2;&#xA0;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/twitter-survey-reveals-the-subscription-options-its-eyeing-including-an-undo-send-option/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asked users in a survey</a>&#xC2;&#xA0;to evaluate which options were most or least important to them.</p><p>&#x201C;Over the course of this year, you&#x2019;ll see us test subscription products in public,&#x201D; the company&#x2019;s investor relations&#x2019; Twitter account&#xC2;&#xA0;<a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterIR/status/1366821636712722432" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased&#xC2;&#xA0;</a>earlier this week. &#x201C;You&#x2019;ll hear more about them. And hopefully, you&#x2019;ll see some of these products roll out as well.&#x201D;</p><p>Last month, Twitter&#xC2;&#xA0;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/25/tech/twitter-super-follow-investor-day/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>&#xC2;&#xA0;it is exploring other subscription opportunities, such as a way for users to become paid subscribers to Twitter accounts they like to receive additional content such as exclusive announcements and newsletters. The company has also set an ambitious goal to double its annual revenue by the end of 2023.</p></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP/WSVN) &#8212; Authorities say a Florida couple is facing charges ranging from manslaughter to child neglect involving three children, one of whom died last year.</p>
<p>The Pinellas County Sheriff&#8217;s Office says 33-year-old Ashley Ferguson and 34-year-old Matthew Ferguson were arrested Thursday. She is charged with aggravated manslaughter of a child and two counts of child neglect. He faces three counts of child neglect.</p>
<div class="fb-post" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/pinellassheriff/posts/4696940690332628" data-width="552"></div>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t immediately clear if they have lawyers to represent them.</p>
<p>The case began in July 2020, when deputies were sent to a Clearwater home to investigate a report of an unresponsive child. That child was pronounced dead at the home.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fox13news.com/news/clearwater-couple-charged-with-manslaughter-neglect-after-childs-death" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox 13 reports</a> that the other children could not speak and their legs were so weak they could barely walk. The children were deprived of nutrition, medical treatment and parental care.</p>
<p>Investigators also said the children had bedsores, diaper rash and severely matted hair. Deputies said Ashley Ferguson admitted that the children’s primary source of food was milk.</p>
<p>The sheriff&#8217;s office also said that the couple never got medical treatment for the children. They added that Ashley Ferguson also admitted to Matthew Ferguson that she had lied about medical appointments.</p>
<p>Detectives said the two surviving children received immediate medical care, including oral surgery and feeding therapy. In addition, they will also get physical and speech therapy.</p>
<p>The couple was booked into the Pinellas County jail. Ashley Ferguson was being held without bail. Matthew Ferguson was being held in lieu of $40,000 bail.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DALLAS (AP) — A Dallas police officer was arrested Thursday on two counts of capital murder, more than a year and a half after a man told investigators that he kidnapped and killed two people at the officer&#8217;s instruction in 2017, authorities said.</p>
<p>Bryan Riser, a 13-year veteran of the force, was arrested Thursday morning and taken to the Dallas County Jail for processing, according to a statement from the police department. A lawyer for him couldn&#8217;t immediately be identified.</p>
<p>Riser was arrested in the unconnected killings of Liza Saenz, 31, and Albert Douglas, 61, after a man came forward in August 2019 and told police he had kidnapped and killed them at Riser&#8217;s direction, police Chief Eddie Garcia said during a news conference. He said investigators don&#8217;t know the motives for the killings, but that they were not related to Riser&#8217;s police work.</p>
<p>Garcia did not explain why Riser was arrested nearly 20 months after the witness came forward, and police declined to answer subsequent questions about the timing. Riser joined the department in 2008, and Garcia acknowledged that he had been patrolling Dallas while under investigation for the killings.</p>
<p>The chief stressed that his homicide division and the FBI were still investigating the killings and said the department was reviewing Riser&#8217;s arrests.</p>
<p>Saenz’s body was pulled from the Trinity River in southwest Dallas on March 10, 2017, with several bullet wounds, the chief said. Douglas was reported missing that year and his body hasn’t been found.</p>
<p>Three people were previously arrested and charged with capital murder in Saenz’s killing, according to an affidavit for Riser&#8217;s arrest. It does not identify any of them by name.</p>
<p>One of them allegedly told police that he and Riser were involved in burglaries when they were young. They more recently hatched a plan to rob drug stash houses, but they didn&#8217;t follow through with it, according to the affidavit.</p>
<p>Instead, the man told investigators that Riser offered to pay him a total of $9,500 to kidnap and kill Douglas and later Saenz. Both were shot and their bodies were dumped in the river, according to the court record.</p>
<p>The affidavit states that Riser told the hired killer Saenz was an “informant.” The document does not elaborate, and police declined to answer questions about whether Saenz had some connection to the department.</p>
<p>The murder charges are not the officer&#8217;s first alleged crimes. In May 2017, Riser faced a domestic violence charge for allegedly assaulting and injuring an ex-girlfriend. It wasn&#8217;t immediately clear how that case was resolved. Police said Riser “received summary discipline for an incident.”</p>
<p>Riser has been put on administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal affairs investigation. Garcia said “we’re going to expedite our process” toward his firing.</p>
<p>“We will not allow anyone to tarnish this badge,&#8221; the chief said.</p>
<p>Riser had not been booked into the jail as of early Thursday afternoon, a sheriff’s spokesman said.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Dallas County district attorney’s office said her office didn’t have information on the case.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IRWIN, Pa. (WSVN) &#8212; A Pennsylvania McDonald&#8217;s worker is celebrating her 100th birthday and said she has no plans to settle down and retire.</p>
<p>Wednesday marked Ruth Shuster&#8217;s 100 birthday, and for her, it was just another Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t feel any different,&#8221; Shuster told <a href="https://www.fox13news.com/news/i-feel-im-the-lucky-one-mcdonalds-employee-turns-100-years-old-with-no-plans-to-quit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FOX Television Stations</a> after her co-workers threw her a party.</p>
<p>Shuster started working for McDonald&#8217;s in 1994, when she was 73 years old. Now, 27 years later, she is still at it.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, Shuster would greet and help customers. Now, she helps out where she cans and works to boost employees&#8217; morale.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re nice to work for, and I&#8217;m lucky they keep me here at my age,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I feel I&#8217;m the lucky one.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said she has no plans to retire. &#8220;No way at all. I don’t even think of that,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>“I became a widow when I was 50, and I’ve been working ever, ever, ever since, and I like working,&#8221; Shuster told <a href="https://wpde.com/news/nation-world/woman-who-works-at-mcdonalds-celebrates-100th-birthday-requests-birthday-cards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WTAE</a>.</p>
<p>WTAE reports that McDonalds has set up a special mailbox for Shuster to receive birthday cards. If you would like to send her a card, you can address it to 9061 Lincoln Hwy, North Huntingdon, PA 15642.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MANVEL, Texas (WSVN) &#8212; A young father left a heartbreaking message behind for his children shortly before he died from complications of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Charles &#8220;Charley&#8221; Torres died on Valentine&#8217;s Day 2021, weeks after he was diagnosed with COVID-19.</p>
<p>But before he passed, he recorded a video for his children.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love you with all my heart,&#8221; Torres said while struggling to breathe through a mask. &#8220;I love you so much. Know that daddy loves you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Torres then said the names of his three children and four step-children before telling them again that he loved them and to take care of their mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things that he did that was most important was that he loved his children and took care of his children,&#8221; Charley’s father, Alex, told <a href="https://www.fox13news.com/news/know-that-daddy-loves-you-35-year-old-father-records-video-for-children-before-dying-from-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FOX Television Stations</a> on Wednesday. &#8220;He wanted to make sure he left something for the kids just in case that things started going wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Torres&#8217; father said his son went to the emergency room in mid-January for what he believed was a bout of pancreatitis, something he had suffered with since 2010. However, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 and was put on a ventilator. He later succumbed to the virus.</p>
<p>&#8220;You never think it&#8217;s going to happen to you,&#8221; Alex said. &#8220;I’ve been praying to God my entire life that I never outlive my children.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — A couple driving home from Florida flipped and wrecked their car while swerving to avoid a couch that fell off a truck. And though both escaped serious injury, there was no avoiding a $166 traffic ticket dropped off at the hospital where they were treated.</p>
<p>Jake Singer told the <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/transportation/fl-ne-i-95-couch-accident-citation-20210303-cbgh7lglxfh55nqlhoycgp7hwe-story.html#nt=pf-double%20chain~homepage-top-heads~flex%20feature~curated~home-heads-13~CBGH7LGLXFH55NQLHOYCGP7HWE~1~3~3~13~art%20yes">South Florida SunSentinel</a> that his girlfriend was driving Feb. 20 on Interstate 95 as they returned to Washington, D.C., after a monthlong visit with family in Boca Raton.</p>
<p>Singer said his girlfriend swerved to avoid the couch and that their 2006 Toyota Corolla struck the median and flipped over — and the truck kept going.</p>
<p>The car was totaled and both were taken to the hospital in ambulances, he said, lucky to have survived. But then a Florida Highway Patrol trooper showed up at the hospital to deliver the traffic ticket for “failing to drive in a single lane,” according to the agency&#8217;s crash report.</p>
<p>“He gave us a ticket for basically swerving lanes while trying to avoid a couch that was flying at us on the highway,” Singer told the newspaper.</p>
<p>Singer and his girlfriend were hanging upside down, and passersby helped them out of the vehicle, according to the newspaper report. She asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>A Florida Highway Patrol spokesman, Lt. Yanko Reyes, told the newspaper that while it&#8217;s a tough break for the couple, troopers have discretion when issuing traffic citations. He added that drivers are supposed to maintain control of their vehicles.</p>
<p>“You have to look at the totality of the circumstances,” Reyes said. “Remember, in Florida it is recommended to have at least a two-vehicle length between your vehicle and the vehicles in front of you because that way you have enough time to react in case something like this happens, in case somebody brakes, in case debris falls on the roadway.”</p>
<p>Singer said he attempted to reason with the trooper who brought the citation to the hospital.</p>
<p>“But the starting point is that you’re giving us a safe road to drive on, and that’s the sort of contract we have, and I’m pretty sure couches flying in the air breaks the contract, and we have to do whatever to stay alive,’” he told the newspaper.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina senators Tuesday added a firing squad to the electric chair as alternatives if the state can&#8217;t execute condemned inmates...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina senators Tuesday added a firing squad to the electric chair as alternatives if the state can&#8217;t execute condemned inmates by way of lethal injection.</p>
<p>The Senate then approved <a href="https://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess124_2021-2022/bills/200.htm">the bill</a> on a key 32-11 vote with several Democrats joining Republicans in the proposal which would allow South Carolina to restart executions after nearly 10 years.</p>
<p>The state can&#8217;t put anyone to death now because its supply of lethal injection drugs expired and it has not been able to buy any more. Currently, inmates can choose between the electric chair and lethal injection and since the drugs are not available, they pick the method that can&#8217;t be done.</p>
<p>The Senate bill keeps lethal injection if the state has the drugs, but requires prison officials to use the electric chair if it does not. An inmate could choose a firing squad if they prefer.</p>
<p>The House is considering <a href="https://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess124_2021-2022/bills/3755.htm">a similar bill </a>without the firing squad option, but it could also consider the Senate version after a procedural vote by senators finalizes the bill later this week.</p>
<p>South Carolina still uses the electric chair first powered up in 1912 after taking over the death penalty from counties, which usually used hanging.</p>
<p>It is just one of nine states that maintains an electric chair. It would become just the fourth state to allow a firing squad with Utah, Oklahoma and Mississippi, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.</p>
<p>South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster asked for lawmakers to give him any way to restart executions since a few inmates have exhausted their appeals but their death sentences can’t be carried out.</p>
<p>A Republican and a Democrat, both former prosecutors, proposed adding the firing squad.</p>
<p>The Democratic former prosecutor said it is evident in a Republican dominated state like South Carolina where the GOP gained extra seats in November that the death penalty can&#8217;t be abolished <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virginia-death-penalty-repeal-governor-c98c16a996037a4d1e1d497787b7e6f1">like Virginia did</a> last month.</p>
<p>“The death penalty is going to stay the law here for a while. If it is going to remain, it ought to be humane,&#8221; said state Sen. Dick Harpootlian, who said hanging is brutal and often leads to decapitation and in electrocution, the condemned “are burned to death.”</p>
<p>Since the last execution was carried out in May 2011, South Carolina’s death row has dropped from about 60 inmates <a href="http://www.doc.sc.gov/news/death-row-report.pdf">to 37 </a>as of now because of natural deaths and prisoners winning appeals and being resentenced to life without parole. Prosecutors have sent just three new inmates to death row in the past decade.</p>
<p>The Republican former prosecutor, Sen. Greg Hembree, said Tuesday was not the time to debate whether the death penalty was right or wrong.</p>
<p>But several Democrats said the moral aspect of putting someone to death could not be removed from discussions over the method.</p>
<p>They also asked senators how they could justify having a debate over putting people to death this week when last month they passed a bill outlawing most abortions in South Carolina, which is now tied up in court.</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Kevin Johnson brought up <a href="https://apnews.com/article/64264298f4724defb7bd1f30d4ccf32e">George Stinney</a>, the youngest person executed in the U.S. in the 20th century. He was 14 when he was sent to South Carolina&#8217;s electric chair after a one-day trial in 1944 for killing two white girls. A judge threw out the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/12430910e5e846248029e0e52c78b49a">Black teen’s conviction</a> in 2014 . Newspaper stories reported that witnesses said the straps to keep him in the electric chair didn’t fit around his small frame.</p>
<p>Johnson drives by a memorial to Stinney each time he comes to Columbia from Manning.</p>
<p>“You think it was bad to abort a baby? Think how much worse it is to kill a person who when all is said and done is innocent,&#8221; Johnson said.</p>
<p>Only one senator in the chamber has seen an execution. Hembree, the co-sponsor of the firing squad proposal, tried nearly a dozen death penalty cases as a prosecutor and watched one of the men he condemned to death die by lethal injection.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing pleasant about any of those forms. They are gruesome, they are sad and tragic in a way,&#8221; Hembree said. “Justice is not always a happy place. But it is justice.”</p>

Ron DeSantis and state health officials came under deeper scrutiny amid revelations that seniors in a wealthy enclave in Key Largo received hundreds of life-saving vaccinations as early as mid -January, giving ammunition to critics who say the Republican governor is favoring wealthy constituents over ordinary Floridians.</p>
<p>The revelations were the latest example of wealthy Floridians getting earlier access to coronavirus vaccines, even as the state has lagged in efforts to get poorer residents vaccinated.</p>
<p>DeSantis pushed back Thursday, saying a local hospital — not the state — was behind the vaccinations of more than 1,200 residents of the exclusive Ocean Reef Club in Key Largo, Florida, and that the state “wasn&#8217;t involved in it in any shape or form.”</p>
<p>Despite the governor&#8217;s denials of quid pro quos, the charges of favoritism were amplified by money pouring into the governor&#8217;s campaign coffers from wealthy benefactors with ties to communities awarded vaccination sites — like the one in Key Largo. One resident of Ocean Reef, Republican former Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner, last week gave the Florida governor&#8217;s campaign committee $250,000.</p>
<p>Revelations about Ocean Reef residents getting vaccinated were <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/florida-keys/article249666463.html">first reported by the Miami Herald</a>.</p>
<p>The inequitable distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines is becoming a public relations challenge for the governor. As of Wednesday, nearly 3.3 million Floridians had received at least one shot of the two-step vaccination process, about three-quarters of them 65 or older. But less than 6% have been Black — about a third of their share of the state&#8217;s population.</p>
<p>Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried joined Democratic U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist in calling for federal officials to probe the DeSantis administration’s vaccine distribution programs.</p>
<p>“If this isn’t public corruption, I don’t know what is,” Fried said Thursday at a press conference in the Florida Capitol, calling on the FBI&#8217;s public corruption to launch an investigation.</p>
<p>“Give campaign contributions big dollars, get special access to vaccines &#8212; ahead of seniors, ahead of our teachers, ahead of our farmworkers and so many of our residents here in our state of Florida who are scared and who are wanting these vaccines.”</p>
<p>Citing reporting from the Herald, Fried noted that DeSantis in February had his biggest fundraising haul since 2018, when he was running for governor.</p>
<p>In asking the U.S. Department of Justice to look into matter, Crist, a former Florida governor, asserted last week that DeSantis were benefiting &#8220;political allies and donors, over the needs of higher-risk communities and existing county waitlists.”</p>
<p>Both Crist and Fried are considering campaigns to oppose DeSantis in next year&#8217;s gubernatorial election.</p>
<p>Other Florida Democrats, including the top Democrat in the state Senate, Gary Farmer, joined in the call for a federal investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The exchange of hard-to-get vaccines for political contributions is nothing short of criminal,&#8221; Farmer said in a letter dashed off to acting U.S. Attorney General Monty Wilkinson.</p>
<p>During a Thursday news conference, DeSantis expressed no misgivings about the early vaccinations at the exclusive Key Largo community.</p>
<p>“If you are 65 and up, I am not worried about your income bracket,&#8221; he said. “I am worried about your age bracket because it’s the age, not the income, that shows the risk.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the governor called the controversy “a manufactured narrative with political motivations.”</p>
<p>“Leadership matters and because of Governor Ron DeSantis’ commitment to ensuring vaccine access to all seniors – regardless of background, income or zip code – millions of seniors have received the vaccine, resulting in over 50 percent of our state’s senior population being vaccinated, the highest in the nation,” said the spokesperson, Meredith Beatrice.</p>
<p>The Republican Party of Florida came to the governor’s defense, calling the controversy “another bogus conspiracy theory.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter what party you belong to, whether you are rich or poor, if you qualify for the vaccine, you can get a vaccine,” said Helen Aguirre Ferre, the state party’s executive director.</p>
<p>The Ocean Reef Club, a senior community in Key Largo, had more than 1,200 homeowners vaccinated through their second dose by late January, according to a message to community members by the management obtained by the Miami Herald.</p>
<p>Those vaccinations came at a time when “the majority of the state has not received an allocation of first doses,” the management noted.</p>
<p>Officials from Monroe County, home to Key Largo, said the affluent club’s medical center received the vaccines through the Baptist Health hospital as part of the governor’s program to vaccinate communities with a populations of people 65 and older. County spokeswoman Kristen Livengood said the allocations were coordinated through Baptist and the state of Florida.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, other reports have surfaced of wealthy retirement communities getting exclusive access to vaccine doses through pop-up vaccine sites. Democrats have criticized him for choosing those places, but the governor’s office has noted that more than half of them have been in Democratic stronghold counties of Broward and Palm Beach. Supporters of DeSantis say he has also coordinated clinics with faith-based groups in underserved areas.</p>
<p>Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat and the state&#8217;s director of the Division of Emergency Management, said the administration is working “diligently” to increase vaccine access in underserved communities.</p>
<p>After Publix was made the sole distributor of vaccines in Palm Beach County in late January, the mayors of predominately Black farming communities in the area urged the governor to reconsider, and the state set up a vaccine station shortly after.</p>
<p>While critics point to disparities in vaccine distributions as a call for more outreach into underserved areas of the state, including in communities of color and impoverished neighborhoods, DeSantis noted that &#8220;demand was relatively tepid in FEMA sites in Miami, Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville. The governor said the four sites had the capacity to administer 12,000 doses but only vaccinated 6,500 people.</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>A previous version of the story erroneously reported the donation amount given by former Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner to the Florida governor&#8217;s campaign committee.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IONE, Calif. (AP) — A California serial killer who authorities say strangled and raped at least seven women was fatally choked himself in a state prison, officials said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Roger Reece Kibbe, 81, known as the “I-5 Strangler” in the 1970s and 1980s, was spotted unresponsive Sunday in his cell at Mule Creek State Prison southeast of Sacramento — his 40-year-old cellmate standing nearby.</p>
<p>An autopsy showed Kibbe had been manually strangled, the Amador County Sheriff’s Office said, calling the death a homicide.</p>
<p>No charges have been filed in the death of Kibbe, a former suburban Sacramento furniture maker whose brother was a law enforcement officer.</p>
<p>He was initially convicted in 1991 of strangling Darcine Frackenpohl, a 17-year-old who had run away from her home in Seattle. Her nearly nude body was found west of South Lake Tahoe below Echo Summit in September 1987.</p>
<p>Investigators said then that they suspected him in other similar slayings.</p>
<p>But it wasn&#8217;t until 2009 that a San Joaquin County District Attorney’s Office investigator used new developments in evidence to connect him to six additional slayings in multiple Northern California counties, with several victims found alongside Interstate 5 or other highways in 1986. Kibbe was serving multiple life terms for the slayings when he was killed.</p>
<p>Authorities said they never stopped trying to prove that he was responsible for even more deaths. Investigators secretly took him on multiple field trips from prison with the hope that he would reveal the whereabouts of more victims.</p>
<p>They would buy him an egg McMuffin and a Coke for breakfast, another Coke and a hamburger and fries for lunch, Vito Bertocchini, a retired San Joaquin County sheriff’s detective and district attorney’s investigator, told <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/california/article249635438.html?ac_cid=DM397579&amp;ac_bid=-376335684">The Sacramento Bee</a>.</p>
<p>Bertocchini spent nearly two decades pursuing Kibbe and thinks he must have killed others during the 10-year gap between his first and last known slayings. Investigators have said they found other women who had been killed and dumped with Kibbe&#8217;s trademark of cutting his victims’ clothing in odd patterns.</p>
<p>He was finally captured after Sacramento police said a would-be victim escaped and they recovered a garrote made from a pair of dowels and parachute cord along with scissors and other items.</p>
<p>Investigators said they matched the cord to rope found with Frackenpohl’s body and at Kibbe&#8217;s house, all with microscopic dots of red paint. DNA eventually linked him to two other victims, and he agreed to cooperate in exchange for prosecutors taking the death penalty off the table.</p>
<p>Kibbe never admitted to other killings beyond those with which he was charged, but Bertocchini said he never stopped trying to elicit another confession.</p>
<p>Even after he retired in 2012, each year he sent Kibbe birthday and Christmas cards, asking him to speak up if he recalled anything about other victims. He and his old partner last visited Kibbe in prison in 2019, but still he wouldn&#8217;t admit to any more victims.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s too late, but Bertocchini called Kibbe&#8217;s death by strangulation “some fitting justice.”</p>
<p>“I don’t wish ill on anyone,” Bertocchini said. “But I hope he remembered every one of his victims while he was being killed.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(CNN) &#8212; Oh, the places Dr. Seuss books will go after they ignite controversy.</p>
<p>This week, Dr. Seuss Enterprises announced that six books penned by the children&#8217;s author <a href="https://wsvn.com/entertainment/6-dr-seuss-books-wont-be-published-for-racist-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will no longer be published</a> because of the &#8220;hurtful and wrong&#8221; ways characters of color are portrayed.</p>
<p>Now, Dr. Seuss books have soared to the top of Amazon&#8217;s bestseller list, occupying nine out of the marketplace&#8217;s top 10 books.</p>
<p>No. 1? &#8220;The Cat in the Hat,&#8221; followed by &#8220;One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish&#8221; and &#8220;Oh, the Places You&#8217;ll Go!&#8221;</p>
<p>None of the discontinued books feature on Amazon&#8217;s list. So, where did they go?</p>
<h3><strong>First, into the hands of fans</strong></h3>
<p>The six books &#8212; &#8220;And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,&#8221; &#8220;If I Ran the Zoo,&#8221; &#8220;McElligot&#8217;s Pool,&#8221; &#8220;On Beyond Zebra!,&#8221; &#8220;Scrambled Eggs Super!,&#8221; and &#8220;The Cat&#8217;s Quizzer&#8221; &#8212; quickly sold out from booksellers like Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble.</p>
<p>While Dr. Seuss Enterprises has not announced the discontinuation of any other books, fans and collectors seem to be stocking up just in case.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not costing them much. &#8220;Green Eggs and Ham,&#8221; for example, sells for just under $5 on Amazon.</p>
<p>Dr. Seuss books currently make up about half of Amazon&#8217;s top 50 best selling books.</p>
<h3><strong>Then, to the corners of the Internet</strong></h3>
<p>On eBay, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/BANNED-Last-chance-If-I-Ran-The-Zoo-by-Dr-Seuss-Brand-New/193933395945?hash=item2d2754c7e9:g:6jcAAOSw6phgQA-Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the books are selling for $4,000</a>.</p>
<p>On Amazon, copies of &#8220;If I Ran the Zoo&#8221; start at $939 and climb to $5,000.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Cat&#8217;s Quizzer&#8221; can be yours for $875 &#8212; or for $1,600, if you can handle a book cover with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cats-Quizzer-Smarter-Beginner-Books/dp/0394832965/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1GU9KUZYQKWV0&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+cat%27s+quizzer&amp;qid=1614866468&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=the+cat%27s+q%2Cstripbooks%2C198&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;very modest rubbing.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>One listing on eBay &#8212; five of the six discontinued books for $2,500 &#8212; is averaging 63 views per hour.</p>
<p>The discontinued books became rare collectibles almost instantly, simultaneously igniting controversy over the enterprise&#8217;s decision to cease publishing.</p>
<h3><strong>The books portray harmful stereotypes</strong></h3>
<p>The discontinued books are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/02/us/dr-seuss-books-cease-publication-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not quite anomalies</a> in Dr. Seuss&#8217; career.</p>
<p>Ever since his days at Dartmouth College, <a href="https://sophia.stkate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1050&amp;context=rdyl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he had been producing racist and anti-Semitic work</a>. Drawing Black boxers as gorillas and leaning into harmful Jewish stereotypes, Dr. Seuss&#8217; history of harm is longer than some may think.</p>
<p>In a 2019 <a href="https://sophia.stkate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1050&amp;context=rdyl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a>, researchers found that from 50 books, nearly all characters of color had Orientalist characteristics &#8212; that is, offensive depictions of Asia and Asian characters.</p>
<p>Dr. Seuss Enterprises wrote in a statement that it worked with a panel of experts, including educators, to review the author&#8217;s titles and decide on discontinuation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ceasing sales of these books is only part of our commitment and our broader plan to ensure Dr. Seuss Enterprises&#8217;s catalog represents and supports all communities and families,&#8221; the business wrote.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASHVILLE (<a href="https://www.wsmv.com/news/tennessee/joint-effort-leads-to-agencies-finding-150-missing-children/article_65e8b1d8-7c40-11eb-a693-cfce00fed91b.html?block_id=994460" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN</a>) &#8212; A joint operation between the U.S. Marshals Service, Tennessee Department of Children’s Services and the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation resulted in the finding of 150 missing children across the state.</p>
<p>Planning for the effort, named Operation Volunteer Strong, began in fall 2020 with operation efforts launching on Jan. 4.</p>
<p>After identifying 240 missing children statewide, TBI intelligence analysts compiled information and potential leads on each, which designated law enforcement teams carefully pursued during two-week blitzes in each of Tennessee’s three grand regions.</p>
<p>U.S. Marshals said at least two of the missing children were identified as a possible human trafficking victim.</p>
<p>“Whatever we can do to help these children from falling into dangerous situations, we will do,” said David Jolley, U.S. Marshal for the Eastern District of Tennessee.</p>
<p>“I can’t imagine being a parent and not knowing where my child is, or can you imagine being that child, maybe feeling forgotten? I can’t imagine those circumstances,” said Denny King, U.S. Marshal for the Middle District of Tennessee.</p>
<p>King said one of the recovered children in Middle Tennessee was identified as a potential human trafficking victim, resulting in a still-active investigation.</p>
<p>King said one child was found who had been missing for 460 days.</p>
<p>“We can’t give up. Missing kids out there, we will continue to look for you,” said King.</p>
<p>Tyreece Miller, U.S. Marshall for the Western District of Tennessee, said one of the recovered children from there was also identified as a potential human trafficking victim, resulting in a still-active investigation by law enforcement in Mississippi and the FBI.</p>
<p>Miller said another child was recovered during an active kidnapping investigation in Memphis, resulting in the arrest of the suspect on multiple charges.</p>
<p>“We are grateful to be part of this effort, but our work is not done,” said Miller. “Our commitment to finding our missing children will not end.”</p>
<p>Tennessee Department of Children’s Services Commissioner Jennifer Nichols said 93 of the children found are DCS children, most of them girls.</p>
<p>“We are committed to providing the services these children deserve,” said Nichols. “The works is transformational. We cannot stop and there in nothing more worthwhile.</p>
<p>“Our mission ‘That guilt shall not escape, nor innocence suffer’ is more than a motto. It reminds us every day of what really matters,” said TBI Director David Rausch. “In this operation, it was the innocence of children who may need help or love, a new start or just someone safe to talk to. At TBI, we’re committed to playing a part in that kind of work for the long haul and look forward to continuing these types of operations in the future.</p>
<p>“It is critical for families and children to know that even though this operation has ended, we will continue to look for you.”</p>
<p>A look at the blitz in each of Tennessee’s grand divisions:</p>
<p>East Tennessee: Jan. 4-15</p>
<p>Authorities identified 86 missing children of which 56 were recovered, five of them in other states. Of the 56 children recovered, authorities located 27 of them in the weeks leading up to the operation, and three after it concluded. Law enforcement identified three of the recovered juveniles as potential human trafficking victims, resulting in a still-active TBI investigation. “The U.S. Marshals are committed to assisting state and local agencies with locating and recovering endangered missing children to help prevent their falling victim to crimes of violence and exploitation,” said Jolley. “We will use every resource at our disposal to help find these missing children.”</p>
<p>Middle Tennessee: Jan. 25-Feb. 5</p>
<p>Authorities identified 72 missing children, of which 42 were recovered. Of the 42 children recovered, authorities located 29 of them in the weeks leading up to the operation and 13 during the operation. Law enforcement identified one child as a potential human trafficking victim, resulting in a still-active TBI investigation. We can’t give up. We need the public, the media, and all law enforcement to not give up,” said King. “If you see something, or know something, say something. We cannot give up and stop searching for our most vulnerable and those who cannot help themselves.”</p>
<p>West Tennessee: Feb. 8-12 and Feb. 22-26</p>
<p>Authorities identified 82 missing children, of which 52 were recovered, three of them in other states. Of the 52 children recovered, authorities located 33 of them in the weeks leading up to the operation, 18 during the operation and one after it concluded. While searching for missing children, authorities located two adults with outstanding warrants. Law enforcement identified one of the recovered juveniles as a human trafficking victim, resulting in a still-active investigation by a Mississippi local law enforcement agency and FBI. Authorities safely recovered a child during an active kidnapping investigation, resulting in the arrest of the suspect. “I hope this operation changes the course for 150 young lives and leads them to the path of opportunities every child deserves,” said Miller. “Our efforts should also serve notice to those who prey on society’s most vulnerable that these children are not forgotten. Investigations will continue and the next knock at the door could be for you.”</p>
<p>The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, based in Alexandria, VA, provided research and analytical support during the operation.</p>
<p>“Operation Volunteer Strong is a great example of how working together, we can find missing children and get them the help they need to move forward,” said John Clark, NCMEC’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “We’re thrilled to see so many missing children recovered in Tennessee and we thank all the agencies involved for their dedication to child protection.</p>
<p>The TBI serves as the clearinghouse for missing children in Tennessee. In this role, the agency provides support to local law enforcement agencies, raises awareness of missing children and prevention efforts, and administers high-profile efforts to locate missing children in dangerous situations through its Endangered Child Alert and AMBER Alert programs.</p>
<p>“Many people don’t realize this, but hundreds of children go missing in our state every month,” said TBI Director David Rausch. “From runaway that may leave their home out of desperation or despair, to those entangled in a custody battle, every single one of them deserves a fighting chance, and that’s why they also deserve our best work to help them.”</p>
<p>Most of the children recovered during the operation will receive services through the Tennessee Department of Children’s Services, which may include placements in foster homes, group homes or other specialized care.</p>
<p>“We are grateful that missing children have been recovered and are now receiving the services and treatment they need to stay safe and healthy,” said DCS Commissioner Jennifer Nichols. “This operation was truly a collaboration and it’s strengthened our relationship with our law enforcement partners. Working together, the agents, marshals and DCS case managers put in countless hours to track down leads and locate these missing children.”</p>
<p>Investigators ask, if you know anything about where a missing child might be located, that you give them a call.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FLINT, Mich. (<a href="https://www.wnem.com/news/flint-man-who-spent-nearly-25-years-in-prison-starts-new-career-in-cannabis-industry/article_a813fc9e-7b9f-11eb-9226-739f6cf12ef6.html?block_id=994426" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN</a>) &#8212; After spending more than two decades behind bars, the very drug that put him there is providing Michael Thompson with a new, life-changing opportunity.</p>
<p>Thompson launched a new career on Tuesday, March 2 in the cannabis industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s been like heaven. It&#8217;s been like heaven man, you know,&#8221; Thompson said.</p>
<p>Words are hard for Thompson to find when it comes to describing his freedom. CNN affiliate WNEM was there as Thompson was released from prison after 25 years in January because Gov. Gretchen Whitmer commuted his sentence.</p>
<p>March 2 was Thompson&#8217;s first day on the job for Ubaked Cannabis, a cultivation and processing facility in Burton. The company is offering Thompson a platform to talk about justice system reform.</p>
<p>&#8220;The owner here understands my cry to help them,” Thompson said. “So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m here for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thompson had been serving 25 years of a 40 to 60-year sentence for selling three pounds of marijuana and owning guns. His grandson, Michael, who also works for Ubaked, says that&#8217;s an injustice that plays out far too often.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody should&#8217;ve did that much time for no marijuana, nobody,&#8221; Thompson said.</p>
<p>Bob Dodge is the CEO for Ubaked Cannabis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Personally, I felt indebted that we are profiting from this industry after he spent 25 years in prison,&#8221; Dodge said.</p>
<p>Flint man serving up to 60 years for selling pot 24 years ago Dodge said Thompson isn&#8217;t allowed near the product, but he said Thompson&#8217;s position is a win-win for both Thompson and the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We go to dispensaries and we do vendor days and that may be an opportunity for us to incorporate you and you know hire you as a brand ambassador and get your message out there,&#8221; Dodge said.</p>
<p>Thompson was quick to point out there are a lot of people in prison right now who are just like him. He says he&#8217;ll do everything he can to raise awareness that in many cases the punishment doesn&#8217;t fit the crime.</p>
<p>&#8220;The criminal justice system is broken and it needs to be fixed,&#8221; Thompson said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(CNN) &#8212; It started as a joke.</p>
<p>Cassandra Madison, 32, and Julia Tinetti, 31, began telling people they were sisters not long after they met in 2013 while working at The Russian Lady restaurant in New Haven, Connecticut, but a recent DNA test confirmed that they are actually biological sisters.</p>
<p>The two women had a lot in common &#8212; they were both adopted from the Dominican Republic as babies, they looked enough alike that customers and coworkers mixed them up all the time and they each had Dominican flag tattoos.</p>
<p>The tattoos got them talking and they became fast friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hit it off right away. There was no trying to force a friendship or anything,&#8221; Madison told CNN. &#8220;Our personalities are very similar, so it was very easy for us to just start hanging out.&#8221;</p>
<p>They really leaned in to the sisterhood gag and would sometimes wear matching clothes to work.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had an event that we went to that we dressed alike &#8212; our socks matched, our sneakers matched, our sunglasses matched our shorts were black &#8212; she made us tank tops that said that she was the big sister and I was the little sister,&#8221; Tinetti said. &#8220;We kind of just went with it like as a joke. It was not serious at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>At one point, they looked through their adoption paperwork to see if they might really be sisters, but the forms said they had different mothers who lived hours away from each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we said, &#8216;Okay, never mind, forget it, then we&#8217;re not,&#8217; and we just moved on with our lives,&#8221; Madison said. &#8220;But we still played into us being sisters even though we knew that we weren&#8217;t. Well, we thought we weren&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madison moved to Virginia Beach, Virginia, in 2015 and the pair mostly only kept in touch over Facebook.</p>
<p>Madison had grown up knowing that her biological parents had given her up for adoption because they couldn&#8217;t afford to care for her.</p>
<p>She always wanted to meet them and, in 2018, her adoptive mom gave her a DNA test kit for Christmas.</p>
<h3>Seven siblings in the Dominican Republic</h3>
<p>Madison thought she&#8217;d just learn more about where her ancestors came from, but it also turned up a cousin, who also lived in Connecticut and knew her dad.</p>
<p>Her biological mom died in 2015, but Madison has been to the Dominican Republic to meet her dad and family members. They welcomed her at the airport wearing shirts with her picture on them.</p>
<p>There were seven other children in the family.</p>
<p>Madison and Tinetti reconnected last year and realized that something seemed off about their paperwork.</p>
<p>Tinetti&#8217;s best friend, Molly, was adopted from the Dominican Republic on the same day and their moms stayed in touch over the years. Molly&#8217;s adoption papers said that she and Madison had the same mothers, but her DNA results showed that they were distant cousins.</p>
<p>Madison talked to her father about it and he told her that they had given another daughter up for adoption.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Why would you not tell me this?&#8217; And he&#8217;s just like &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry. It was just a very difficult time in our lives and your mom and I, we don&#8217;t like to talk about it,'&#8221; Madison said.</p>
<p>Madison drove from Virginia to Connecticut to get Tinetti to take a DNA test.</p>
<p>Tinetti agreed to take the test even though she had never had any interest in learning about her biological family.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a great family growing up, I got a good education, I didn&#8217;t feel like I was missing anything in my life,&#8221; Tinetti said. &#8220;I was happy with the life that I had. I didn&#8217;t feel the need to do it.&#8221;</p>
<h3>&#8216;This is it&#8217;</h3>
<p>Tinetti got the test results back in late January.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was like, &#8216;This is it,&#8217; and I waited for probably like 10 minutes before I even opened it, because I was trying to prepare myself for what was going to be there,&#8221; Tinetti said.</p>
<p>Both women said they&#8217;d tried not to get their hopes up, but they knew they would have been devastated if they had not turned out to be biological sisters.</p>
<p>Madison said she talks to her dad and siblings every day and that she and Tinetti have picked up right where they left off.</p>
<p>Tinetti said she&#8217;s had video chats with her biological father and her siblings and hopes to go to the Dominican Republic to meet them in person.</p>
<p>She said it was &#8220;quite shocking&#8221; to see them because they look so much alike.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was like seeing myself in these people,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s like, &#8216;Okay, well, now I know where I come from,&#8217; you know what I mean? It has always been a mystery for me.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(CNN) &#8212; A bill in the Tennessee Legislature would officially make Dolly Parton&#8217;s version of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/biden-harris-inauguration-day-2021/h_c74465b9b0e294cdf8101f7e4fc6dcb3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Amazing Grace&#8221;</a> the state hymn, adding to its <a href="https://www.tn.gov/about-tn/state-songs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 state songs.</a></p>
<p>The bill was introduced <a href="https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=HB0938&amp;ga=112" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier this month</a>. State Rep. Mike Sparks and Sen. Raumesh Akbari proposed the bill because they believe that the song has historical significance for their state.</p>
<p><a href="https://capitol.tn.gov/Bills/112/Bill/HB0938.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Argument for the bill</a> talks at length about songwriter John Newton&#8217;s faith and his eventual denunciation of slavery.</p>
<p>Newton worked on a slave trade ship in the 1700s, but through a series of events realized the evil of the trade and became an ordained minister and worked to dismantle slavery in England.</p>
<p>&#8220;During his first year serving in Olney (England), he wrote the hymn &#8220;Amazing Grace,&#8221; which became one of the most celebrated songs in modern history,&#8221; the bill says.</p>
<p>The song has crossed ethnicities over its history, as captured by over 3,000 recordings of the song in the<a href="https://www.loc.gov/collections/amazing-grace/about-this-collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Library of Congress</a>, some of them dating back as early as the 1930s.</p>
<p>The state acknowledges that many others with Tennessee connections have sung the song &#8212; such as Elvis Presley, Garth Brooks, Willie Nelson and Aretha Franklin &#8212; but they are choosing Dolly Parton&#8217;s specific rendition. The bill is unclear on why Parton&#8217;s version was chosen.</p>
<p>The state House has yet to vote on the bill.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK (AP) — As widely anticipated, Fox News said Tuesday that it had signed former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany as a contributor to offer commentary on various network programs.</p>
<p>McEnany, former President Donald Trump&#8217;s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-joe-biden-kayleigh-mcenany-joe-lockhart-db516ee1055da1891cc3b32b0b9d4ff8">final press secretary</a>, didn&#8217;t speak about her new role during an interview with Fox&#8217;s Harris Faulkner that aired Tuesday.</p>
<p>It was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-larry-kudlow-kayleigh-mcenany-58f61b819e20ce588dc84723dabb3306">reported in January</a> that McEnany had disclosed to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics while still in office that she would work for Fox after leaving the White House. Fox said at the time that it had been in discussions with McEnany but had paused them.</p>
<p>Before working for Trump, McEnany was a commentator at CNN.</p>
<p>While at the White House, McEnany frequently appeared on Fox News programs for interviews.</p>
<p>She said Tuesday that her biggest regret at the White House was not being able to hold a briefing outlining all the accomplishments of the Trump administration.</p>
<p>“But after Jan. 6, it just was not tenable,” she said.</p>
<p>She said that “everyone in the administration was horrified” by the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, led by a mob of Trump supporters, but she insisted that it did not represent the former president&#8217;s backers.</p>
<p>Asked if she believed Trump bore any responsibility for the riot, she said, “No, I don&#8217;t.”</p>
<p>Trump was impeached by the House on a charge of incitement of insurrection over the insurrection but acquitted by the House. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell voted to acquit Trump, citing the fact that the former president was out of office by the time the Senate trial began, but McConnell said Trump was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-donald-trump-impeachments-trump-impeachment-mitch-mcconnell-0a14d2e41e376331580b98a992f7d856">&#8220;practically and morally responsible for provoking&#8221;</a> the riot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden said the U.S. expects to take delivery of enough coronavirus vaccine for all adults by the end of May — two months earlier than anticipated — and he pushed states to get at least one shot into the arms of teachers by the end of March to hasten school reopenings.</p>
<p>Biden also announced Tuesday that drugmaker Merck will help produce rival Johnson &amp; Johnson’s newly approved one-shot vaccine, likening the partnership between the two drug companies to the spirit of national cooperation during World War II.</p>
<p>“We’re now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Despite the stepped-up pace of vaccine production, the work of inoculating Americans could extend well into the summer, officials said, depending both on the government’s capacity to deliver doses and Americans’ willingness to roll up their sleeves.</p>
<p>Biden’s announcements quickly raised expectations for when the nation could safely emerge from the pandemic with the promise of speedier vaccinations, but even as he expressed optimism, Biden quickly tempered the outlook for a return to life as it was before the virus hit.</p>
<p>“I’ve been cautioned not to give an answer to that because we don’t know for sure,” Biden said, before saying his hope for a return to normal was sometime before “this time next year.”</p>
<p>As Biden spoke, states across the country were moving to relax virus-related restrictions. This despite the objections of the White House and the nation&#8217;s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who have warned against any relaxation of virus protocols until more Americans are vaccinated.</p>
<p>In Texas, GOP Gov. Greg Abbott moved to lift his state’s mask-wearing mandate and a host of other limitations. Michigan’s Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer eased capacity limits on restaurants and both public and residential gatherings.</p>
<p>Fauci has previously said the nation must achieve a vaccination rate of about 80% to reach “herd immunity.&#8221; Only about 8% of the population has been fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, though the pace of vaccination has been increasing. The U.S. set a new daily record for injections last Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>In hopes of increasing vaccinations even further. the Biden administration told governors to make preparations to administer even more doses in the coming weeks. More shots are also headed toward the federally backed program to administer doses in retail pharmacies, which federal officials believe can double or triple their pace of vaccination.</p>
<p>More than 800,000 doses of the J&amp;J vaccine will also be distributed this week to pharmacies, on top of the 2.4 million they are now getting from Pfizer and Moderna.</p>
<p>Those pharmacies will be key in getting the vaccines into the arms of teachers — particularly in the roughly 20 states where they have not been prioritized for shots. The aim is to help reopen schools to better educate students who have been at risk of falling behind during the pandemic and reduce the burden on parents who have had to choose between childcare and a job.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let’s treat in-person learning as the essential service that it is,&#8221; Biden said. Teachers will be able to sign up directly through participating retail pharmacies, the administration said.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki also announced Tuesday that the federal government was increasing supply of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines to states next week to 15.2 million doses per week, up from 14.5 million previously. States will also receive 2.8 million doses of the J&amp;J shot this week.</p>
<p>On a call with governors Tuesday, White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients said states should prepare to administer 16 million to 17 million total weekly doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines by the end of March, climbing to 17 million to 18 million weekly by early April. The supply of J&amp;J doses to states, expected to dip after the initial shipment this week, will climb to 4 million to 6 million weekly doses by the end of March and 5 million to 6 million doses weekly through the end of April.</p>
<p>Officials have said J&amp;J faced unexpected production issues with its vaccine and produced only 3.9 million doses before being cleared for emergency use authorization on Saturday. The company has promised to deliver 100 million doses by the end of June.</p>
<p>Before the approval of the J&amp;J shot, Biden had suggested that it would take until the end of July to have enough vaccine for every adult in the U.S.</p>
<p>Facing questions about the company&#8217;s slipping delivery schedule, J&amp;J Vice President Richard Nettles told lawmakers on Capitol Hill last week that the company had faced “significant challenges” because of its “highly complex” manufacturing process.</p>
<p>Psaki said that an &#8220;across-the-administration effort” was required to get the two historic rivals to work together on the vaccines, even though conversations between J&amp;J and Merck have been going on for months.</p>
<p>“There’s a difference between conversations and it moving forward,” she said.</p>
<p>The White House said Merck would devote two plants to the production process. One would make the vaccine and the other would handle inserting the vaccine into vials and ensuring strict quality controls. Psaki said the Biden administration was using its powers under the Defense Production Act to help Merck retool to work on the production.</p>
<p>Still it was not immediately clear when the effect of Merck’s assistance would be reflected in supply. Federal officials have cautioned that setting up the highly specialized manufacturing lines to produce vaccines would take months.</p>
<p>Compared to the two-dose versions produced by Moderna and Pfizer, the J&amp;J vaccine is less resource-intensive to distribute and administer, making it critical for U.S. plans to spread vaccinations around the world — but only once Americans are inoculated. The J&amp;J vaccine can be stored for months at refrigerated temperatures, rather than frozen, and doesn’t require patients to return for a second dose three or four weeks later.</p>
<p>J&amp;J has set up a global production network that includes brewing bulk vaccine at its Janssen facility in the Netherlands, and with a company in the U.S., Emergent BioSolutions, and another in India, Biological E. Ltd. Other contract manufacturers are lined up to help with later steps, including putting the vaccine into vials, in the U.S., Italy, Spain and South Africa.</p>
<p>In the scramble to create COVID-19 vaccines, the three Western drug makers who’ve dominated the vaccine industry for decades — Merck &amp; Co., Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline — surprisingly all fell short. Merck halted its own plans to develop a coronavirus vaccine earlier this year, finding that their candidates were generating an inferior immune system response compared with other vaccines. It said it would instead focus its work on developing treatments for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Now, amid the global clamor for more vaccine doses, those heavyweights are helping manufacture doses for less-experienced rivals whose vaccines won the first emergency authorizations from regulators.</p>
<p>Merck has since said it was in talks to help other drug companies with vaccine production, but wouldn’t say Tuesday whether other deals are imminent.</p>
<p>“Merck remains steadfast in our commitment to contribute to the global response to the pandemic and to preparing to address future pandemics,” the Kenilworth, New Jersey-based company said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HOLTVILLE, Calif. (AP) — An SUV packed with 25 people pulled in front of an oncoming tractor-trailer on a two-lane highway cutting through farmland near the U.S-Mexico border early Tuesday, killing 13 and leaving bodies strewn across the roadway. Most of the dead were Mexicans, a Mexican official said.</p>
<p>When police arrived, some of the passengers were trying to crawl out of the crumpled 1997 Ford Expedition while others were wandering around the fields. The rig&#8217;s front end was pushed into the SUV&#8217;s left side and two empty trailers were jackknifed behind it.</p>
<p>Twelve people were found dead when first responders reached the highway, which winds through fields in the agricultural southeastern corner of California about 125 miles (201 kilometers) east of San Diego. Another person died at a hospital, California Highway Patrol Chief Omar Watson said.</p>
<p>“It was a pretty chaotic scene,” said Watson, who also described it as “a very sad situation.”</p>
<p>Roberto Velasco, director of North American affairs for Mexico’s Foreign Relations Department, confirmed Tuesday on his Twitter account that at least 10 of those killed have been identified as Mexicans. No identities have been released.</p>
<p>The cause of the collision was unclear, authorities said, and it also was not immediately known why so many people were crammed into a vehicle built to hold eight people safely.</p>
<p>Watson said the SUV only had front seats — the middle and back seats had been removed. That would allow more people to fit into the vehicle but makes it even more unsafe.</p>
<p>As the investigation unfolds, authorities will seek to answer whether the SUV was carrying migrants after they crossed the border as part of a smuggling operation, ferrying farmworkers to fields, or being used for some other purpose.</p>
<p>Macario Mora, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection, said agents were not pursing the SUV at the time of the crash, which was initially rumored He said the immigration status of the passengers was unknown and being investigated.</p>
<p>“It was an unusual number of people in an SUV, but we don’t know who they were,” Mora said.</p>
<p>The people in the vehicle ranged in age from 15 to 53 and were a mix of males and females, officials said. The driver was from Mexicali, Mexico, just across the border, and was among those killed. The 69-year-old driver of the big rig, who is from nearby El Centro, was hospitalized with moderate injuries.</p>
<p>The passengers&#8217; injuries ranged from minor to severe and included fractures and head trauma. They were being cared for at several hospitals. One person was treated and released from a hospital.</p>
<p>The crash occurred around 6:15 a.m. at an intersection just outside Holtville, which dubs itself the world’s carrot capital and is about 11 miles (18 kilometers) north of the U.S.-Mexico border. It was a sunny, clear morning and authorities said the tractor-trailer and its two empty containers were northbound on State Highway 115 when the SUV pulled in front of it from Norrish Road.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear if the SUV ran a stop sign or had stopped before entering the highway. It&#8217;s also not yet known how fast the tractor-trailer was traveling.</p>
<p>The speed limit for tractor-trailers on the highway is 55 mph (88.5 kph), according to CHP Officer Jake Sanchez. The other road is also 55 mph for vehicles.</p>
<p>A 1997 Ford Expedition can carry a maximum payload of 2,000 pounds. If it had 25 people inside, that would easily exceed the payload limit, which taxes the brakes and makes it tougher to steer, said Frank Borris, former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Office of Defects Investigation.</p>
<p>“You’re going to have extended stopping distances, delayed reactions to steering inputs and potential over-reaction to any type of high-speed lane change,” said Borris, who now runs a safety consulting business.</p>
<p>SUVs of that age tended to be top-heavy even without carrying a lot of weight, Borris said.</p>
<p>“With all of that payload above the vehicle’s center of gravity, it’s going to make it even more unstable,” he said.</p>
<p>The crash occurred amid verdant farms that grow a wide variety of vegetables and alfalfa used for cattle feed.</p>
<p>Thousands of people cross into the U.S. each day to work in the fields. The harvest of lettuce and other winter vegetable crops runs from November until March, and buses and SUVs carrying farmworkers are often rumbling down the rural roads s in the early morning hours.</p>
<p>The area has also seen smugglers carrying migrants in trucks and vehicles. Hundreds of migrants who died after crossing the border are buried in unmarked graves in Holtville’s cemetery on the edge of town.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida officials are recommending that the state&#8217;s antiquated unemployment processing system be replaced after a review confirmed what had long been known: a broken system full of glitches that was incapable of handling the unprecedented deluge of jobless claims spawned by the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>The state&#8217;s Department of Economic Opportunity is recommending that the current system, known as CONNECT, be discarded and replaced with a more robust and modern system that employs cloud-based technology that could allow the system to more nimbly respond to increased demands.</p>
<p>The department, which oversees the state&#8217;s unemployment system, is asking lawmakers for $73 million over the next two years to modernize the system that left hundreds of thousands of jobless Floridians without unemployment checks for weeks and sometimes months.</p>
<p>The director of the agency, Dane Eagle, told lawmakers Monday that Florida was not alone in its struggles.</p>
<p>“We are far behind in where we need to be,” he said. “Florida is not the only state to experience these challenges.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as the unemployment rate surged when businesses closed, Florida was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ec6da9c1e29d0fa10a74812201ac97e2">among the slowest states</a> — if not the slowest — in getting unemployment checks to those with no other income to pay mortgages, rents and other necessities.</p>
<p>Glenn Barca, a 53-year-old self-employed driver who had to max out his credit cards to pay bills and groceries while waiting months for his unemployment checks, said it took 70 to 80 attempts just to complete a simple application process because the website repeatedly crashed.</p>
<p>“The process was a nightmare,” said Barca, who typically makes the bulk of his income during Florida’s busy tourist season until the pandemic halted travel.</p>
<p>“Although late, it’s still never too late to try and get answers so we can hopefully begin to see drastic changes,” he said Monday.</p>
<p>Gov. Ron DeSantis, who likened the benefits claim system to an “old jalopy” breaking down at the Daytona 500, ordered the inspector general to investigate. The Economic Opportunity Department launched a review of its own, and the results were presented Monday to the legislative select committee on pandemic preparedness and response.</p>
<p>The report makes clear that the system was neither prepared nor responsive at a time of crisis, when some 1.3 million Floridians, at the peak of unemployment in April, tried to access benefits through online portals that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/5ad29f05102e6cdfda803650ae745c24">continually crashed</a> or phone systems that only <a href="https://apnews.com/article/7e2c1653f31a42717b030fd3262e2f86">added to frustrations</a>.</p>
<p>The long awaited inspector general’s report could be released in a matter of weeks. The inspector general’s findings are current being reviewed by economic opportunity officials.</p>
<p>The CONNECT system prompted concern from the start. Soon after the online portal launched in October 2013, it was beset by system crashes that prevented people from claiming benefits. Despite previous audits that identified numerous glitches, many of the problems were never addressed. Those same system failures prevented people from accessing the system.</p>
<p>Critics warned that the system was doomed to fail.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, as it turns out, we were absolutely correct,&#8221; said Democratic state Rep. Evan Jenne, the House minority co-leader.</p>
<p>Since the start of the pandemic, more than 3.1 million people have filed unemployment claims in Florida. The state has paid out more than $23.1 billion in benefits — less than a fourth of that from the state&#8217;s reemployment assistance program.</p>
<p>The rest of the funds came from federal pandemic relief packages, some of it earmarked to supplement meager unemployment checks and to provide benefits to gig workers and others who were not eligible for traditional state benefits.</p>
<p>The state&#8217;s electronic portal was initially unable to process claims filed by freelancers and other independent contractors, adding to confusion, frustration and anger. The state eventually put in place a parallel electronic system to handle claims from nontraditional workers.</p>
<p>In fact the state&#8217;s electronic portal was so overwhelmed that state officials reverted to filing claims on paper forms.</p>
<p>As part of its just-completed review, the Department of Economic Opportunity is also asking lawmakers for authority to establish an Office of Accountability and Transparency, but it was unclear in a presentation submitted to the pandemic committee exactly what its role would be. In addition, it wants to create a Reemployment Assistance Modernization Strategic Planning Office to oversee the modernization effort.</p>
<p>The new money requested by the Economic Opportunity Department adds to the $39 million COVID-19-related outlays in its current year budget. The $73 billion being requested for the next two years would nearly double the department’s budget during the same time period. A more modest $8 million is also being requested to supplement the department&#8217;s typical annual budget of $41.3 million in the three years after.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, the Reemployment Assistance System budget was about $12 million annually.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the state’s Unemployment Benefit Trust Fund has been dramatically depleted. Its balance is now just $777 million &#8212; less than a fifth of the $4 billion it had before the pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PITTSBURGH, Pa. (<a href="https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2021/02/26/man-reports-vehicle-as-stolen-sets-it-on-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN</a>) &#8212; A Pennsylvania man is facing multiple charges after police say he falsely reported his vehicle as stolen then set it on fire.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, state police say 54-year-old Donald Cassidy of West Newton reported his vehicle as stolen.</p>
<p>A few days later, the vehicle was found off of White Ridge Road in Mt. Pleasant Township. Police say it had been set on fire and it was unrecognizable. A VIN number on the back of the vehicle matched one belonging to Cassidy, police say.</p>
<p>After taking his phone and executing a search warrant, police say a look through his Google history turned up the search, “how to set your car on fire and make it look like an accident.”</p>
<p>He’s facing charges of arson, false reports and risking a catastrophe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LARGO, Fla. (WSVN) &#8212; A Florida nurse has been left paralyzed from the neck down after he contracted a deadly illness shortly after beating COVID-19.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.fox13news.com/news/covid-19-related-illness-leaves-largo-nurse-paralyzed-from-neck-down" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox 13</a>, 23-year-old Desmon Silva has been recovering in a Massachusetts hospital with his mother by his side.</p>
<p>In July, Silva was out to dinner with his girlfriend when he started suffering neck pains. Minutes later, he lost feeling in his hands and was rushed to the hospital.</p>
<p>By the time he made it to the hospital, he was unresponsive, placed on a ventilator and was admitted to the intensive care unit.</p>
<p>Doctors ultimately determined Silva was paralyzed from the neck down.</p>
<p>Silva&#8217;s mother, Barbara Bonnett, told Fox 13 her son tested positive for COVID-19 about two months before he was rushed to the hospital, but said his case was mild and he recovered.</p>
<p>However, the virus weakened his immune system, and he developed an infection called Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis or ADEM, an illness that attacks the central nervous system.</p>
<p>Now, doctors are working to study Silva&#8217;s case and are trying to find out why he became paralyzed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) &#xE2;&#x80;&#x94; The Medical Board of California said it would investigate a plastic surgeon who appeared in a videoconference for his traffic violation trial while operating.<p>The&#xC2;&#xA0;<a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article249549993.html">Sacramento Bee reports&#xC2;&#xA0;</a>Dr. Scott Green appeared Thursday for his Sacramento Superior Court trial, held virtually because of the coronavirus pandemic, from an operating room. He was dressed in surgical scrubs with a patient undergoing the procedure just out of view; the beeps of medical machinery can be heard in the background.</p><div><embed type="oembed">https://twitter.com/sacbee_news/status/1365412908826587141</embed></div><p>&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;Hello, Mr. Green? Hi. Are you available for trial?&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D; asked a courtroom clerk as an officer summoned to appear in trial raised her eyebrows. &#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;It kind of looks like you&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;re in an operating room right now?&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D;</p><p>&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;I am, sir,&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D; Green replied. &#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;Yes, I&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;m in an operating room right now. Yes, I&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;m available for trial. Go right ahead.&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D;</p><p>The clerk reminded Green the proceedings were being livestreamed because traffic trials are required by law to be open to the public, and Green said he understood. He appeared to continue working with his head down while waiting for Court Commissioner Gary Link to enter the chamber.</p><p>When Link appeared and saw the doctor on the screen, the judge hesitated to proceed with the trial out of concern for the welfare of the patient.</p><p>&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;I have another surgeon right here who&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;s doing the surgery with me, so I can stand here and allow them to do the surgery also,&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D; Green said.</p><p>The judge said he didn&#x2019;t think it was appropriate to conduct trial under the circumstances. He told Green he&#x2019;d rather set a new date for trial &#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;when you&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;re not actively involved or participating and attending to the needs of a patient.&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D;</p><p>Green apologized.</p><p>&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;Sometimes, surgery doesn&#x2019;t always go as,&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D; he said before the judge interrupted him.</p><p>&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;It happens. We want to keep people healthy, we want to keep them alive. That&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;s important,&#x201D; Link said.</p><p>The board said it would look into the incident, saying it &#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;expects physicians to follow the standard of care when treating their patients.&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D;</p><p>A call seeking comment from Green has not been returned.</p></p>

					<description><![CDATA[HYDERABAD, India (AP) — A man was killed by a rooster with a blade tied to its leg during an illegal cockfight in southern India,...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HYDERABAD, India (AP) — A man was killed by a rooster with a blade tied to its leg during an illegal cockfight in southern India, police said, bringing focus on a practice that continues in some Indian states despite a decades-old ban.</p>
<p>The rooster, with a 3-inch knife tied to its leg, fluttered in panic and slashed its owner, 45-year-old Thangulla Satish, in his groin last week, police inspector B. Jeevan said Sunday.</p>
<p>The incident occurred in Lothunur village of Telangana state.</p>
<p>According to Jeevan, Satish was injured while he prepared the rooster for a fight. “Satish was hit by the rooster’s knife in his groin and started bleeding heavily,&#8221; the officer said, adding that the man died on the way to a hospital.</p>
<p>Jeevan said police filed a case and were looking for over a dozen people involved in organizing the cockfight. If proven guilty, the organizers can be jailed for up to two years.</p>
<p>Cockfights are common in the southern Indian states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka despite a countrywide ban imposed in 1960. Animals rights activists have for long been calling to control the illegal practice, which is mainly organized as part of local Hindu festivals usually attended by hundreds of people, though the crowds sometimes swell to thousands. The cockfights are often held under the watch of powerful, local politicians and involve large sums of betting money.</p>
<p>Last year, a man was killed when a blade attached to his bird’s leg hit him in the neck during a cockfight in Andhra Pradesh. In 2010, a rooster killed its owner by slashing his jugular vein in West Bengal state.</p>
<p>According to police, the rooster involved in last week&#8217;s incident was among many other roosters prepared for the cockfight betting festival in Lothunur village.</p>
<p>As the practice goes, a knife, blade or other sharp-edged weapon is tied to the leg of a bird to harm its rival. Such fights continue until one contestant is either dead or flees, declaring the other rooster the winner.</p>
<p>Officer Jeevan said the rooster was brought to the police station before being taken to a local poultry farm. “We may need to produce it before the court,” he said.</p>
<p>Images of the rooster tied with a rope and pecking on grains at the police station were widely viewed on social media.</p>

<p>Erica Marie Farmer, 34, was arrested for the crime. Farmer also faces a theft of property 2nd charge. According to officials, the theft of any livestock in the state of Alabama falls under the felony guideline.</p>
<p>Farmer&#8217;s bond was set at $6,000.</p>
<p>Deputies say, Farmer removed the goat from her neighbor&#8217;s property and brought it to her house to show her child. They say at some point she decided to paint the animal and post the photos to social media.</p>
<p>They say when the goat&#8217;s owner discovered the animal was missing, they called a different neighbor to ask if they had seen the goat and at that time the neighbor told them photos of the painted animal had been posted to social media.</p>
<p>The goat&#8217;s owner called authorities. Deputies say the goat was still at the suspect&#8217;s house when deputies arrived.</p>

Members of her family, including granddaughter Wanda Jackson, were at Friday&#x2019;s renaming ceremony along with Acting NASA Administrator Steve Jurczyk, the agency announced. Jackson died in 2005 at the age of 83.</p><div><embed type="oembed">https://twitter.com/NASA/status/1365455355715592195</embed></div><p>Jackson worked at NASA for 34 years, starting as a research mathematician, and eventually became the agency&#x2019;s first Black female engineer. She later moved into administration and worked at NASA&#x2019;s equal opportunity office, leading programs that influenced the hiring and promotion of female mathematicians, engineers and scientists.</p><p>In 2019, Jackson was&#xC2;&#xA0;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/09/us/hidden-figures-congressional-medals-trnd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal</a>, the nation&#x2019;s highest civilian honor, under the Hidden Figures Congressional Gold Medal Act.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) &#8212; The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide whether it is unconstitutional to exclude people living in Puerto Rico from Supplemental Social Security Income.</p>
<p>The justices said they would hear an appeal, first filed by the Trump administration, of a lower-court ruling that held that residents of the U.S. territory should have the same access to SSI benefits as older, disabled and blind Americans in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>The administration argues that a pair of 40-year-old Supreme Court decisions already upheld the federal law that created SSI and excluded Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories from it. Congress later added in the Mariana Islands.</p>
<p>In recent months, a federal judge ruled that Puerto Rico residents should have access to other federal welfare benefits from which they have been excluded as well. A federal judge in Guam said residents of that Pacific island also should be able to collect SSI.</p>
<p>A separate program, Aid to the Aged, Blind and Disabled, covers residents of the territories, but it has more stringent eligibility requirements and pays less generous benefits than SSI.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Democratic-led House passed a bill Thursday that would enshrine LGBTQ protections in the nation&#8217;s labor and civil rights laws, a top priority of President Joe Biden, though the legislation faces an uphill battle in the Senate.</p>
<p>The bill passed by a vote of 224-206 with three Republicans joining Democrats in voting yes.</p>
<p>The Equality Act amends existing civil rights law to explicitly include sexual orientation and gender identification as protected characteristics. The protections would extend to employment, housing, loan applications, education, public accommodations and other areas. Supporters say the law before the House on Thursday is long overdue and would ensure that every person is treated equally under the law.</p>
<p>“The LGBT community has waited long enough,&#8221; said Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who is gay and the bill&#8217;s lead sponsor. “The time has come to extend the blessings of liberty and equality to all of Americans regardless of who they are and who they love.&#8221;</p>
<p>Republicans broadly opposed the legislation. They echoed concerns from religious groups and social conservatives who worry the bill would force people to take actions that contradict their religious beliefs. They warned that faith-based adoption agencies seeking to place children with a married mother and father could be forced to close, or that private schools would have to hire staff whose conduct violates tenets of the school&#8217;s faith.</p>
<p>“This is unprecedented. It&#8217;s dangerous. It&#8217;s an attack on our first freedom, the first freedom listed in the Bill of Rights, religious liberty,&#8221; said Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La.</p>
<p>The House <a href="https://apnews.com/article/a64dc269b2864b89aad3e0d110f4f536">passed</a> the Equality Act in the last Congress with unanimous Democratic support and the backing of eight Republicans, but Donald Trump&#8217;s White House opposed the measure and it was not considered in the Senate, where 60 votes will be needed to overcome procedural hurdles. Democrats are trying to revive it now that they have control of Congress and the White House, but passage still appears unlikely in the evenly divided Senate.</p>
<p>This time, Republican Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and John Katko and Tom Reed of New York sided with Democrats in voting for the bill.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court provided the LGBTQ community with a resounding victory last year in a 6-3 ruling that said the Civil Rights Act of 1964 applied to LGBTQ workers when it comes to barring discrimination on the basis of sex. Civil rights groups have encouraged Congress to follow up that decision and ensure that anti-bias protections addressing such areas as housing, public accommodations and public services are applied in all 50 states.</p>
<p>Biden made clear his support for the Equality Act in the lead-up to last year&#8217;s election, saying it would be <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ab96c4d9b3a84ef9b10598781ff38e93">one of his first</a> priorities.</p>
<p>Democratic Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Penn., said the Equality Act is needed to end “the patchwork of state laws” around gay rights and create “uniform nationwide protection.”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s been personal since my baby sister came out to me almost 40 years ago,&#8221; Scanlon said. “For many people all across this country and across this House, that is when the fight hits home.&#8221;</p>
<p>The debate among lawmakers on Capitol Hill also become personal. Rep. Marie Newman, D-Ill., whose daughter is transgender, tweeted a video of herself placing a transgender flag outside her office. Her office is across the hall from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who was recently blocked from serving on two committees because of past comments and tweets.</p>
<p>“Our neighbor, @RepMTG, tried to block the Equality Act because she believes prohibiting discrimination against trans Americans is “disgusting, immoral, and evil.” Thought we’d put up our Transgender flag so she can look at it every time she opens her door.,&#8221; Newman tweeted.</p>
<p>Greene responded with a video of her own in which she puts up a sign that reads: “There are Two genders: MALE and FEMALE. “Trust The Science!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Our neighbor, @RepMarieNewman, wants to pass the so-called “Equality” Act to destroy women’s rights and religious freedoms. Thought we’d put up ours so she can look at it every time she opens her door,&#8221; Greene tweeted.</p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., pointed to the exchange to advocate for the bill Thursday.</p>
<p>“It breaks my heart that it is necessary, but the fact is, and in fact we had a sad event here even this morning, demonstrating the need for us to have respect,&#8221; Pelosi said, at one point pausing and taking a deep sigh. “Not even just respect, but take pride, take pride in our LGBT community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gay and lesbian members of Congress spoke about how meaningful the bill is for them.</p>
<p>“Look, we&#8217;re not asking for anything that any other American doesn&#8217;t already enjoy,&#8221; said Rep. Chris Pappas, D-N.H. “We just want to be treated the same. We just want politicians in Washington to catch up with the times and the Constitution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leaders at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops wrote lawmakers this week to say they had grave concerns about the bill. Among the concerns they raised is that the bill would expand the government&#8217;s definition of public places, forcing church halls and equivalent facilities to host functions that violate their beliefs, which could lead to closing their doors to the broader community.</p>
<p>Republicans cited an array of consequences they said could occur if the bill passed into law, from eliminating the existing ban on the use of government funds for abortion, to allowing transgender people into women&#8217;s shelters and transgender youth into girls sports. Democrats likened the effort to past civil rights battles in the nation&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>Cicilline challenged Republicans, “I hope you will bear in mind how your vote will be remembered years from now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the nation&#8217;s largest corporations are part of a coalition in support of the legislation, including Apple Inc., AT&amp;T, Chevron and 3M Co., just to name a few of the hundreds of companies that have endorsed it.</p>
<p>After the vote advocacy groups weighed in, with the Human Rights Campaign describing the vote as “bringing us closer to ensuring that every person is treated equally under the law.&#8221; Meanwhile, the conservative Alliance Defending Freedom called on the Senate to “reject this dangerous bill — for the good of all Americans.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>NEW YORK (AP) &#x2014; Hasbro created confusion on Thursday when it removed the gender from its Mr. Potato Head brand, but not from the actual toy.<p>The company, which has been making the potato-shaped plastic toy for nearly 70 years, announced Thursday morning that it was dropping Mr. from the brand in an effort to make sure &#x201C;all feel welcome in the Potato Head world.&#x201D; That set off a social media frenzy over the beloved toy.</p><p>Later that afternoon, Hasbro clarified in a tweet that the Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head characters will still exist, names and all, but the branding on the box will say &#x201C;Potato Head.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;While it was announced today that the POTATO HEAD brand name &amp; logo are dropping the `MR.&#x2019; I yam proud to confirm that MR. &amp; MRS. POTATO HEAD aren&#x2019;t going anywhere and will remain MR. &amp; MRS. POTATO HEAD,&#x201D; the company tweeted.</p><div><embed type="oembed">https://twitter.com/Hasbro/status/1365038178814590995</embed></div><p>Many toymakers have been updating their classic brands in recent years, hoping to relate to today&#x2019;s kids and reflect more modern families.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a potato,&#x201D; said Ali Mierzejewski, editor in chief at toy review site The Toy Insider. &#x201C;But kids like to see themselves in the toys they are playing with.&#x201D;</p><p>Barbie, for example, has tried to shed its blonde image and now comes in multiple skin tones and body shapes. The Thomas the Tank Engine toy line added more girl characters. And American Girl is now selling a boy doll.</p><p>Dropping the &#x201C;Mr.&#x201D; from its brand name could encourage other companies to stop assigning genders to its toys, a trend that has already been happening, said Mierzejewski. Barbie maker Mattel released a gender-neutral doll line in 2019. But Mr. Potato Head is one of the biggest brands to do so.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s setting this new standard,&#x201D; Mierzejewski said.</p><p>GLAAD, an LGBTQ advocacy group, applauded the genderless toy potato.</p><p>&#x201C;Hasbro is helping kids to simply see toys as toys, which encourages them to be their authentic selves outside of the pressures of traditional gender norms,&#x201D; said Rich Ferraro, GLAAD&#x2019;s chief communications officer, in a statement.</p><p>Mr. Potato Head first hit the toy scene in 1952, when it didn&#x2019;t even come with a plastic potato &#x2014; kids had to supply their own vegetable to poke eyes, a nose or mustache into. Hasbro, which also makes Monopoly and My Little Pony, bought the brand and eventually added a plastic spud.</p></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Publix will begin offering COVID-19 vaccines to eligible South Floridians in Miami-Dade and Broward counties.</p>
<p>Starting Monday, all Publix pharmacies in the two counties, 136 in total, will begin administering the vaccine to those 65 and over.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means a lot to me, you know, because that&#8217;s going to give me peace of mind,&#8221; Pierre Chery said.</p>
<p>Appointments can only be made online and will open up to the public on Friday at 7 a.m. Publix said appointments cannot be made by calling the store or the pharmacy.</p>
<p>The online reservation system typically opens every Monday, Wednesday and Friday morning for vaccine appointments at Florida Publix pharmacies, depending on the number of vaccines received from the state and federal governments.</p>
<p>The supermarket chain joins other retailers, such as Walmart and CVS y Mas, to offer COVID-19 vaccinations in South Florida.</p>
<p>Those who can get vaccinated at Publix pharmacies include individuals 65 years of age or older, health care personnel with direct patient contact, a resident of a long-term care facility or a staff member of a long-term care facility.</p>
<p>Cars lined up at a Walmart parking lot in Lauderdale Lakes to receive a vaccine on Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody should get it, protect ourselves and our children and our grandparents and everybody,&#8221; said Fay Tench, who waited in line for a vaccine.</p>
<p>With more vaccines on the way to pharmacies across the region, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said more people will have the opportunity to get inoculated. The governor announced more permanent vaccination sites will come to South Florida, like the Overtown Youth Center, Oak Grove Park in North Miami Beach and Broward Community College North.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking at within the next four to six weeks that you&#8217;re going to see this, potentially, really turn a corner, just in terms of how ready access people have to it,&#8221; DeSantis said in Jacksonville on Thursday. &#8220;These sites will offer at least 200 vaccines a day. I would say without question, barring any problems with the vaccine distribution, you&#8217;re going to see the age lower sometime in March for sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of telling people to be patient, we&#8217;ll need to start persuading the remaining people that haven&#8217;t been vaccinated that they need to be vaccinated,&#8221; Broward County Mayor Steve Geller said.</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration will review data from Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8217;s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine on Friday. If it is granted emergency use authorization, federal officials said 3 to 4 million doses will be ready to go next week.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know for sure how many vaccines that means for the state of Florida,&#8221; DeSantis said. &#8220;We think it&#8217;s gonna be tens of thousands. I mean, I hope it&#8217;s more than that, but at a minimum, we think it will be tens of thousands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Starting on Wednesday, Miami-Dade College&#8217;s North Campus will become a federal mass vaccination site.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be administering 2,000 vaccines each day on site and an additional 1,000 per day through mobile units that will travel directly to harder to reach communities,&#8221; Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said.</p>
<p>Around 200 seniors in Miami received their second dose of the vaccine on Thursday thanks to the city&#8217;s mobile vaccination program.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to keep doing this, so that by the end of next week, beginning of the following, all those who were vaccinated for the first time would have had their second vaccination,&#8221; Miami Commissioner Joe Carollo said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(CNN) &#8212; Two years after Calvin Tyler first enrolled at Morgan State University, he had to drop out because he couldn&#8217;t afford it.</p>
<p>He took a job as a UPS driver, one of the first 10 in Baltimore in 1964. Now &#8212; almost 60 years later &#8212; Tyler has made the largest-ever private donation from an alumnus to the historically Black school, now Morgan State University, it <a href="https://news.morgan.edu/tyler_endowment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced Tuesday.</a></p>
<p>Tyler and his wife, Tina, committed $20 million, with the money going to an already-established endowed scholarship fund in their name. The Calvin and Tina Tyler Endowed Scholarship Fund, established in 2002, initially gave full tuition need-based scholarships to students in Baltimore, Tyler&#8217;s hometown, and has since been expanded to benefit students from anywhere.</p>
<p>With millions unemployed because of the pandemic, it&#8217;s gotten harder for many families to pay for college. And schools are struggling, too, with loss of income from room and board and dropping admissions. Historically Black colleges and universities, which tend to have smaller endowments as a financial buffer, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/18/us/coronavirus-education-hbcu-finances-hit-wellness/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have been hit especially hard</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;My wife and I have become keenly aware of the effect that the pandemic has had on a number of young people trying to get an education (and) we have the resources to help a lot of young people,&#8221; Tyler said in a statement. &#8220;This is why we are increasing our commitment at Morgan; we want to have more full tuition scholarships offered to young people so that they can graduate from college and enter the next stage of their life debt free.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2016, the couple committed $5 million to the school, then the largest such gift in Morgan State&#8217;s history. Their scholarship fund so far has helped more than 200 students attend Morgan State, with 46 receiving full scholarships.</p>
<p>How has a one-time UPS driver accomplished this? After driving for the company, Tyler worked his way up the corporate ladder to senior vice president of operations. He retired in 1998 and joined UPS&#8217;s board of directors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Morgan is so proud to call this son and daughter of the great City of Baltimore our own, and through their historic giving, the doors of higher education will most certainly be kept open for generations of aspiring leaders whose financial shortfalls may have kept them from realizing their academic dreams,&#8221; said the school&#8217;s president, David Wilson.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(CNN) &#8212; A Wisconsin firefighter is in critical condition after a loaded firearm inside a burning building discharged and struck him, according to the fire department.</p>
<p>Justin Frederickson, a firefighter with the Cornell Area Fire Department, was operating on a hose line outside of a fire in the Township of Willard on Feb. 19 when a loaded firearm inside the burning building suddenly discharged. The bullet traveled through the wall of the building and hit him in the abdomen, Fire Chief Dennis Klass <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Cornellareafiredept/posts/2636714516620596?__cft__[0]=AZVGxVveRodDmA5IdtlshuUdDa8SBM1-UFuAFQ1nkvIG3BFDEaBycJQWPRUhaIDgZwOcw5MsU5tQpKIQB2wAhnxwVO-8OLytS9mihtR5kIHSgd6Zl_zQG6T8En4-fm325afFa3uJBviIAmqOjY_dMqOC&amp;__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in a news release</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The loaded firearm discharged due to heat conditions caused by the fire, not by the intentional actions of a person,&#8221; Klass said.</p>
<p>Frederickson was transported to a nearby hospital, then airlifted to Mayo Hospital in Eau Claire, according to the release. He underwent two surgeries and has a third scheduled.</p>
<p>As of Thursday, Frederickson is still listed in critical condition, Cornell Area Fire Department assistant chief Matt Boulding told CNN.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please keep Justin&#8217;s fiancée, his family, and the Cornell and Sheldon Fire Department&#8217;s in your prayers,&#8221; Klass said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(CNN) &#8212; A New Jersey plumber who wanted to help Texans dealing<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/17/us/texas-winter-storm-how-to-help-iyw-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> with burst pipes and other damage</a> after <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/21/weather/texas-winter-storm-timeline/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week&#8217;s winter storms</a> drove to Houston with a truck full of tools and got to work.</p>
<p>Andrew Mitchell and his wife, Kisha Pinnock, decided to make the 22-hour drive from Morristown with their 2-year-old son Blake after hearing that local plumbers were overwhelmed with calls and that some customers couldn&#8217;t get help for weeks. Isaiah Pinnock, who is Kisha&#8217;s brother and Mitchell&#8217;s apprentice, went with them.</p>

(Courtesy: Kisha Pinnock, Esq.)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Before leaving New Jersey, they bought as many plumbing supplies as they could afford, Pinnock said &#8212; because those items are currently hard to find in Texas.</p>
<p>The group arrived in Houston, Texas on Sunday afternoon. Pinnock&#8217;s sister, who lives in Houston, connected them with several people who had been looking to hire plumbers. They quickly enlisted the services of Mitchell&#8217;s Plumbing &amp; Heating.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the time we got here there was already about four or five jobs lined up from my sister, and we just hit those first and then everything after that has really just been referrals from like the initial customers, like their friends and family,&#8221; Pinnock, who is a lawyer, said. &#8220;Since we&#8217;ve been here, it has really been nonstop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pinnock said that her husband and brother had done about 13 jobs since they arrived, and that they have full days scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>Among those customers was Dedrick Dock, of Spring, Texas. He told CNN that he&#8217;d tried to get at least 15 plumbers out to his house before he heard about Mitchell&#8217;s Plumbing &amp; Heating on social media from a friend&#8217;s neighbor.</p>
<p>Dock and his family had been staying with relatives for more than a week because of a broken pipe in the garage.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had to relocate for over a week because we needed to get someone out there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And of course, with the plumbers here they were already overwhelmed with the work that was going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group had planned to return home next week, but now said they will stay for about two weeks, because they&#8217;ve gotten so many calls from people who need their help.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that we made a difference, for sure,&#8221; Pinnock said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[(CNN) &#8212; Costco will raise its starting rate for hourly store workers in the United States to $16 an hour, putting its starting wage above...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(CNN) &#8212; Costco will raise its starting rate for hourly store workers in the United States to $16 an hour, putting its starting wage above rivals such as Amazon, Target and Best Buy.</p>
<p>Costco has around 180,000 US employees, and 90% of them work hourly. It will hike its minimum wage to $16 beginning next week, chief executive Craig Jelinek said Thursday at a US Senate Budget Committee <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/hearing-should-taxpayers-subsidize-poverty-wages-at-large-profitable-corporations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hearing</a> on worker pay at large companies.</p>
<p>The move comes as Democrats in Congress seek to rally support for a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/21/politics/minimum-wage-stimulus-bill-jayapal-khanna-cnntv/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$15 federal minimum wage.</a> Sen. Bernie Sanders is the driving force behind Congress&#8217; current push to raise the federal minimum wage, introducing a bill last month to increase it to $15 by 2025. President Joe Biden has also <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/17/politics/15-dollar-minimum-wage-biden/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed</a> a $15 minimum wage. The federal minimum wage has stood at $7.25 an hour since 2009, but a growing number of cities and states are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/30/business/minimum-wage-2021-states/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising their minimum wage</a>.</p>
<p>Costco, based in Issaquah, Washington, raised its minimum wage to $14 in 2018 and $15 in 2019. The company says 20% of its hourly employees make the minimum wage.</p>
<p>More retailers and restaurant chains have also moved to a $15 an hour minimum rate. Amazon raised its starting wage to $15 in 2018, while Target and Best Buy bumped up their minimums to $15 last year. Walmart, the largest US retailer, has an $11 minimum wage, and it said last week that it planned to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/18/investing/walmart-minimum-wage-retail/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raise pay</a> for around 425,000 employees, a quarter of its workforce, to at least $13 an hour.</p>
<p>Arindrajit Dube, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who studies the minimum wage, said Costco&#8217;s move would put pressure on rival employers such as Amazon to match its $16 minimum.</p>
<p>Although some companies have moved to $15 an hour or above, many business leaders oppose a $15 federal minimum wage. Some employers, particularly small businesses, have fought against raising the minimum wage to $15, saying it could prompt layoffs and even closures.</p>
<p>In a letter to Congressional leaders Wednesday, the Business Roundtable suggested for the first time that the minimum wage hike should be linked to progress in defeating the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Also on Wednesday, Matthew Shay, president of the National Retail Federation, a lobbying group for retailers, said on a call with reporters that &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t make sense for the federal government to be in the business of dictating wages in an economy as broad and diverse in scope as this one is&#8230;It&#8217;s best to let market conditions dictate&#8221; wages.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[NEW YORK (AP) — February is usually the peak of flu season, with doctors&#8217; offices and hospitals packed with suffering patients. But not this year....]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK (AP) — February is usually the peak of flu season, with doctors&#8217; offices and hospitals packed with suffering patients. But not this year.</p>
<p>Flu has virtually disappeared from the U.S., with reports coming in at far lower levels than anything seen in decades.</p>
<p>Experts say that measures put in place to fend off the coronavirus — mask wearing, social distancing and virtual schooling — were a big factor in preventing a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-europe-us-news-flu-11a82c3a91e008d0640948c64e28f9ea">“twindemic”</a> of flu and COVID-19. A push to get more people vaccinated against flu probably helped, too, as did fewer people traveling, they say.</p>
<p>Another possible explanation: The coronavirus has essentially muscled aside flu and other bugs that are more common in the fall and winter. Scientists don&#8217;t fully understand the mechanism behind that, but it would be consistent with patterns seen when certain flu strains predominate over others, said Dr. Arnold Monto, a flu expert at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>Nationally, “this is the lowest flu season we’ve had on record,” according to a surveillance system that is about 25 years old, said Lynnette Brammer of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Hospitals say the usual steady stream of flu-stricken patients never materialized.</p>
<p>At Maine Medical Center in Portland, the state&#8217;s largest hospital, &#8220;I have seen zero documented flu cases this winter,” said Dr. Nate Mick, the head of the emergency department.</p>
<p>Ditto in Oregon&#8217;s capital city, where the outpatient respiratory clinics affiliated with Salem Hospital have not seen any confirmed flu cases.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s beautiful,” said the health system&#8217;s Dr. Michelle Rasmussen.</p>
<p>The numbers are astonishing considering flu has long been the nation&#8217;s biggest infectious disease threat. In recent years, it has been blamed for 600,000 to 800,000 annual hospitalizations and 50,000 to 60,000 deaths.</p>
<p>Across the globe, flu activity has been at very low levels in China, Europe and elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere. And that follows reports of little flu in South Africa, Australia and other countries during the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/16c5e8f7bcdf06feee506e8836d82e19">Southern Hemisphere’s winter months</a> of May through August.</p>
<p>The story of course has been different with coronavirus, which has killed more than 500,000 people in the United States. COVID-19 cases and deaths reached new heights in December and January, before beginning a recent decline.</p>
<p>Flu-related hospitalizations, however, are a small fraction of where they would stand during even a very mild season, said Brammer, who oversees the CDC&#8217;s tracking of the virus.</p>
<p>Flu death data for the whole U.S. population is hard to compile quickly, but CDC officials keep a running count of deaths of children. One pediatric flu death has been reported so far this season, compared with 92 reported at the same point in last year’s flu season.</p>
<p>“Many parents will tell you that this year their kids have been as healthy as they’ve ever been, because they’re not swimming in the germ pool at school or day care the same way they were in prior years,” Mick said.</p>
<p>Some doctors say they have even stopped sending specimens for testing, because they don&#8217;t think flu is present. Nevertheless, many labs are using a CDC-developed “multiplex test” that checks specimens for both the coronavirus and flu, Brammer said.</p>
<p>More than 190 million flu vaccine doses <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-supply-distribution.htm">were distributed</a> this season, but the number of infections is so low that it’s difficult for CDC to do its annual calculation of how well the vaccine is working, Brammer said. There’s simply not enough data, she said.</p>
<p>That also is challenging the planning of next season&#8217;s flu vaccine. Such work usually starts with checking which flu strains are circulating around the world and predicting which of them will likely predominate in the year ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s not a lot of (flu) viruses to look at,&#8221; Brammer said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PHOENIX (AP) &#8212; An Arizona man who stormed the U.S. Capitol seven weeks ago while sporting face paint, no shirt and a furry hat with horns has asked to be released from jail as his lawyer disputed that his client was dangerous because he carried a spear into the riot.</p>
<p>Jacob Chansley, who twice quit eating while in jail until authorities gave him organic food, also is suffering from digestive tract difficulties due to the diet behind bars, said his attorney, Al Watkins, in a court filing Tuesday.</p>
<p>His lawyer also argued a note that his client penned to then-Vice President Mike Pence wasn&#8217;t threatening.</p>
<p>Watkins is trying to undo a mid-January decision by an Arizona judge who concluded Chansley was at risk of fleeing and obstructing justice and posed a danger to the community. The defense lawyer said Chansley, who is now jailed in Alexandria, Virginia, has no prior criminal history and didn&#8217;t act violently, enter offices in the Capitol building or steal classified materials during the Jan. 6 insurrection.</p>
<p>The U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for the District of Columbia, which is prosecuting Chansley, declined to comment on his request for release from jail. A judge in Washington has scheduled a March 5 hearing to consider Chansley&#8217;s request.</p>
<p>Chansley was among hundreds of pro-Trump supporters who charged past outnumbered police officers and stormed the Capitol as Congress was meeting to certify Joe Biden&#8217;s electoral win.</p>
<p>Authorities say Chansley was among the first people to force their way into the Capitol building, disobeyed orders by an officer to leave, refused the officer&#8217;s request to use Chansley&#8217;s bullhorn to tell rioters to leave the Senate chamber and wrote the note while in the Senate to Pence that said, &#8220;It&#8217;s only a matter of time, justice is coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chansley, who calls himself the &#8220;QAnon Shaman&#8221; and has long been a fixture at Trump rallies, unsuccessfully sought a pardon from Trump. He has since apologized for his actions during the insurrection and has soured on Trump, arguing he wouldn&#8217;t have gone to Washington if Trump had not called on him and other followers to go there.</p>
<p>He has pleaded not guilty to felony charges of civil disorder and obstructing an official proceeding, plus four other misdemeanor charges.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said the spear that sat atop a flagpole carried by Chansley into the Capitol was a dangerous weapon. Watkins has characterized the pointed tip as an ornament.</p>
<p>As for the note written to Pence, Watkins said Chansley didn&#8217;t intend to be threatening and was echoing some of the language used by Trump during his Jan. 6 speech that preceded the riot.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s unclear whether Chansley has been offered a COVID-19 vaccination while in jail, Watkins said in the release request that his client, as a practicing Shaman, cannot take a vaccine for the coronavirus. Watkins said his client had refused to take an anthrax vaccine when he served in the military.</p>
<p>Watkins said the culpability of Chansley and others who didn&#8217;t act violently during the insurrection should be &#8220;appropriately contextualized with the unprecedented circumstances surrounding the former president&#8217;s inciting of tens of thousands of individuals to take the actions they took on January 6, 2021.&#8221; Watkins argued others who were arrested have since been released from custody, including people accused of taking property from the Capitol and those associated with extremist groups.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MELBOURNE, Fla. (AP) &#8212; A Florida man is facing animal abuse charges after investigators said two dogs died in his care, sheriff&#8217;s officials said.</p>
<p>David Fritsch, 33, left two dogs locked in a master bedroom with no food for several weeks, Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey said in a Facebook Live post.</p>
<p>Ivey called it &#8220;one of the worst absolute cases of animal cruelty I&#8217;ve ever seen in my 40 years as a cop.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the sheriff, the dogs ate chips of wood from furniture, plastic bottles, plastic bags and band-aids in an attempt to stay alive.</p>
<p>&#8220;These poor animals were literally eating furniture and their own feces trying desperately to stay alive,&#8221; Ivey said.</p>
<p>Investigators were alerted to the situation in January when someone called about two dogs being abandoned in a home. Animal services workers found the dogs dead in the home.</p>
<p>During the live video, the sheriff walked Fritsch into the jail.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you didn&#8217;t get the memo about don&#8217;t hurt animals.&#8221; the sheriff said.</p>
<p>Fritsch remained in the Brevard County Jail on Wednesday. Jail records do not list a lawyer for him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(CNN) &#8212; Chris Wieland was scrolling through TikTok when he saw <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/16/weather/gallery/snowstorm-photos-february-2021/index.html">the devastation</a> that<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/22/us/texas-storm-recovery-monday/index.html"> last week&#8217;s winter storm</a> wreaked on Texans. Within a few days, he had used the platform to raise $7,000 and drove to Killeen, Texas to distribute necessary supplies.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the people of TikTok that came together and rocked this thing,&#8221; he told CNN, &#8220;I was just the driver.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wieland, the owner of All Around Mows &amp; Maintenance in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, was inspired to appeal to his more than 98,000 followers on TikTok to raise money after he saw users in <a href="https://www.killeentexas.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Killeen</a> posting videos showing the destruction caused by last week&#8217;s freeze.</p>
<p>&#8220;I started seeing a lot of posts of people down in Killeen that were having their ceilings fall, their houses were being flooded, I mean, no power, losing all their food,&#8221; Wieland said.&#8221;People talking about they have no drinking water and people haven&#8217;t showered in days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wieland decided to raise as much money as he could for supplies and drive them to Central Texas city himself, a 12-hour trip.<strong> </strong>&#8220;On TikTok, you know, I had a pretty big following. And it was like this money has to be raised fast, this has to be done quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>He posted his first video outlining his plan on Thursday, February 18. &#8220;By Friday morning, the donations were through the roof. It was over $4,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wieland spent his grand total of $7,000 on various necessities, ranging from milk and eggs to personal hygiene products and PVC pipes, &#8220;so they could start fixing their water lines.&#8221; He drove from store to store, buying as many products as possible. With some help from local police and Killeen&#8217;s city coordinator, he set up at a community center with his supplies. &#8220;Within five minutes the street became a line of cars,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s when it really dawned on me because I thought I was going to go down there and help a couple people&#8230;but then when I [saw] that line form that quick, I knew right then that this is bigger than I thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wieland also had some help from local TikTok followers, including one woman who passed her baby over to Wieland so she could get to work directing traffic. &#8220;They were just like, &#8216;we&#8217;re here to help.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Although he was moved by the suffering in Killeen that he saw online, Wieland also felt a personal connection to Texas. &#8220;I lost a dear friend that&#8217;s buried in a Memorial Cemetery [in Texas]&#8230;he served in the military. And he got PTSD real bad, and a couple of years ago he decided he couldn&#8217;t handle it no more,&#8221; said Wieland.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s things, like what&#8217;s going on in Killeen right now, that people will do that. Just because of the stress, I mean, they get hit with no resources, they feel like they can&#8217;t provide, utility bills go through the roof. There&#8217;s just all kinds of factors that, you know, sometimes these things cross people&#8217;s minds. And sometimes they do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never really done nothing for where he was from&#8230;so I just felt this calling that day,&#8221; he added. As a father, &#8220;I&#8217;m always trying to show my boys how to be positive in this world.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ROSEVILLE, Mich. (WSVN) &#8212; A Michigan woman has worked her way up to the top spot at a restaurant chain she began working at as a server.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/black-woman-goes-from-part-time-server-to-owner-of-roseville-outback-steakhouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox 2</a>, Gretta Jackson started as a part-time server at an Outback Steakhouse in Southfield, Michigan, nearly 20 years ago.</p>
<p>She was in her first semester of college at the time and had just given birth to her daughter, Ashley.</p>
<p>&#8220;I made these decisions and choices and have to live with them, but how, at 18, am I going to pull this off?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She decided to take a second job at the restaurant to make some extra money.</p>
<p>Now, after nearly two decades of hard work, she owns an Outback restaurant in Roseville, Michigan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don’t let other people tell you what you can’t do because of your situation. Show them what you can do in spite of your situation,&#8221; Jackson told Fox 2.</p>
<p>Jackson is the first Black woman in the Detroit area to own her own location. She shared the news on Facebook, which then went on to inspire others.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don’t have to make it in the history books in order to make Black history,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What started off as what I thought was just a simple post to celebrate a milestone in my life quickly turned into something else,&#8221; Jackson said. &#8220;I could never imagined so many people would come to say hi and thank you and congratulations to me in person. I&#8217;ve had people send gifts, flowers, Edible Arrangements to the restaurant for me. Just an overwhelming amount of love and support.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also said she is hearing from other Black women working to succeed and how she has become a beacon of hope.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (WSVN) &#8212; A Florida library is being renamed after a former president.</p>
<p>St. Petersburg&#8217;s main library will officially be renamed the President Barack Obama Main Library on Friday, <a href="https://www.fox13news.com/news/st-petes-main-library-to-be-renamed-after-former-president-obama" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox 13 reports</a>.</p>
<p>The dedication will come as a part of the city&#8217;s Black History Month celebrations and to honor the nation&#8217;s first Black president.</p>
<p>&#8220;Highlighting Barack Obama&#8217;s extraordinary story and history-making presidency in this way will inspire generations of young people,&#8221; Mayor Rick Kriseman said in a statement. &#8220;I believe the President Barack Obama Main Library will not only complement city buildings bearing the name of local trailblazers, but will serve as an example to other cities.&#8221;</p>
<p>City officials originally announced in 2018 that the library would be named after the former president.</p>
<p>According to Fox 13, a dedication ceremony will take place Friday at 11 a.m., with the installation of a sign with the library&#8217;s new name. It is one of the first changes in the planned $6 million in renovations for the 55-year-old building.</p>
<p>Other planned changes include the reconfiguration of interior spaces, a renovated outdoor patio, additional parking spaces, ADA-compliant restrooms and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our main library has always been an exciting hub for learning in our city,&#8221; Kriseman said. &#8220;It is made all the better by honoring President Obama.&#8221;</p>
