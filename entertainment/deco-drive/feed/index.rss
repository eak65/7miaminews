										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s treasure right here in South florida, but it&#8217;s not hidden. It&#8217;s out in the open at Aventura Mall.</p>
<p>The luxury jewelry brand Aaron Basha has a pop-up this weekend. This little truck has been making its way around town, and this is your last chance to shop, in person, for some of the same jewelry celebs like to wear.</p>
<p>Regina Basha, Aaron Basha: &#8220;Aaron Basha is a brand that&#8217;s synonymous with family, special moments and making people happy. It&#8217;s magical treasures for the child at heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Shireen Sandoval brand is synonymous with Flamin&#8217; Hot Cheetos and gas station wine. But I digress.</p>
<p>The Basha Beach pop-up is at Aventura Mall until Monday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;The Masked Singer&#8221; isn&#8217;t resting on its laurels as Season 5 promises to deliver more mystery, clues, twists, turns and, of course, celebrities.</p>
<p>Robin Thicke and Jenny McCarthy gave us a sneak peek.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a new season on &#8220;The Masked Singer,&#8221; and this time, wild cards costumes could take a contestant&#8217;s spot.</p>
<p>A mystery celebrity, Cluedledoo, will be handing out hints.</p>
<p>Guest host Niecy Nash will kick things off, then Nick Cannon will return later in the season.</p>
<p>All the panelists are back, and McCarthy is ready to defend her golden ear.</p>
<p>Jenny McCarthy, reigning champion: &#8220;It&#8217;s a little tough, because Ken Jeong is not horrific at guessing this season. The only thing that I would say that I like to do in the past, I would go to escape rooms and practice figuring things out. I&#8217;d like to do that anyway, but since COVID I haven&#8217;t had the chance to do that, so I just have to rely on all the gossip magazines I&#8217;ve ever read and all the interviews I&#8217;ve done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thicke has a fun plan to challenge her.</p>
<p>Robin Thicke, laying it on Thicke: &#8220;I plan on cracking jokes every minute on the show. This season, I&#8217;ve decided to just be the class clown and have more fun than ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for guesses, both panelists have impressed themselves so far.</p>
<p>Robin Thicke: &#8220;I was proud that I got Busta Rhymes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jenny McCarthy: &#8220;Season 1 where I said, &#8216;Could be Cheech or Tommy Chong.'&#8221;</p>
<p>As for spoiler alerts for Season 5, McCarthy still thinks one of the masked contestants is Jamie Foxx.</p>
<p>Robin Thicke: &#8220;Jenny hasn&#8217;t gone a season without guessing Jamie Foxx, and Season 5 is no different, so tune in and find out who Jenny thinks Jamie Foxx is this year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just an FYI, Nash guest-hosted some of the episodes this season after Nick Cannon got COVID-19.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Masked Singer&#8221; is back on Wednesday right after Deco Drive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So many movies, so little time. This week&#8217;s Showtime includes a talking sponge and a talking dragon, and those may not even be the weirdest movies of the bunch. Decide for yourself.</p>
<p>Leslie Jones (as Mary Junson): &#8220;He&#8217;s supposed to be like the Prince of Wakanda.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eddie Murphy (as Akeem): &#8220;Wakanda is a fictional place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leslie Jones (as Mary Junson): &#8220;Not to everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eddie Murphy is back in &#8220;Coming 2 America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thirty-three years after the original, Prince Akeem is now king, and when he learns he has a son back in New York, he&#8217;s off to track down the heir to the throne of Zamunda.</p>
<p>Eddie Murphy: &#8220;When I got the idea, and we got the writers, and we got it on paper, and we had a script, I was like, &#8216;OK, let&#8217;s go do it. I never felt pressure.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Holland (as Todd): &#8220;You know, you might not like my dog or want to hit me over the head or something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daisy Ridley (as Viola): &#8220;I like your dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>In &#8220;Chaos Walking,&#8221; Daisy Ridley crash-lands on a planet where all the women have disappeared.</p>
<p>On the plus side, Tom Holland lives here, but she can hear all men&#8217;s thoughts. All of them.</p>
<p>Deco asked Daisy if she can hack that in real life.</p>
<p>Daisy Ridley: &#8220;I&#8217;m quite a sensitive person, so I tend to pick up on stuff anyway, which is already stressful, because I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Oh, my God, just like live my life!'&#8221;</p>
<p>Kelly Marie Tran (as Raya): &#8220;Six years of searching. Please let this be it. Focus. Eyes forward, Tuk Tuk. Good boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>In &#8220;Raya and the Last Dragon,&#8221; evil forces have taken over.</p>
<p>Raya is a young warrior who needs to find and team up with the world&#8217;s last dragon so the two can save her homeland.</p>
<p>Taylor Takahashi (as Alfred &#8220;Boogie&#8221; Chin): &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to represent. I&#8217;ve got 5,000 years of Chinese history.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pop Smoke (as Monk): &#8220;That&#8217;s a lot of pressure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boogie&#8221; is about an Asian American high school basketball star who wants to score big in the NBA, but first he has to juggle his dreams with the stress of school and family.</p>
<p>Taylor Takahashi: &#8220;&#8216;Boogie&#8217; is a coming-of-age story set in New York, in the backdrop of New York, coming from an immigrant Taiwanese American family, and it&#8217;s the journey through his lens of New York City.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Kenny (as SpongeBob SquarePants): &#8220;I love my live. I love you so much, Gary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Kenny (as Gary): : &#8220;Ow.&#8221;</p>
<p>SpongeBob is on the trail of the snail in &#8220;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run.&#8221;</p>
<p>SpongeBob&#8217;s pet, Gary, is snail-napped, and SpongeBob goes on an epic adventure to get him back.</p>
<p>Character in &#8220;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run&#8221;: &#8220;Seize them!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Kenny (as SpongeBob SquarePants): &#8220;Patrick, what are you doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill Fagerbakke (as Patrick Star): &#8220;Free food!&#8221;</p>
<p>Now you can see SpongeBob for free! For a chance to win a Deco digital code to watch &#8220;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run,&#8221; you know what to do.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Raya and the Last Dragon&#8221; is one for the history books. It&#8217;s Disney Animation&#8217;s first movie inspired by Southeast Asia. The stars are telling Deco how cool it is to be in the new film.</p>
<p>Kelly Marie Tran (as Raya): &#8220;My name is Raya. Our lands have been at war for as long as we can remember.&#8221;</p>
<p>Disney&#8217;s got itself a new princess with the movie &#8220;Raya and the Last Dragon,&#8221; and it&#8217;s safe to say Kelly Marie Tran was excited to score the role of the title character &#8212; meaning Raya, not the dragon.</p>
<p>Kelly Marie Tran: &#8220;I freaked out. Yeah, I was absolutely afraid of it. I think that, you know, we spend so much of our lives wishing and hoping and dreaming about these things, and then we don&#8217;t really think about what we&#8217;re gonna do when we get there, so there was definitely that moment for me, of just disbelief.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kelly Marie Tran (as Raya): &#8220;We really need your help.&#8221;</p>
<p>Awkwafina (as Sisu): &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be real with you. I&#8217;m not like the best dragon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Awkwafina voices the other title character: the dragon!</p>
<p>Awkwafina: &#8220;I always love playing relatable characters. I never really thought I&#8217;d find one in a dragon, and while Sisu is very, very cool, she&#8217;s also imperfect and flawed, and she&#8217;s aware of those flaws, and she&#8217;s very trusting and loving.&#8221;</p>
<p>The film&#8217;s fictional world draws from multiple Southeast Asian countries and influences. Representation is important!</p>
<p>Awkwafina: &#8220;I hope that some people can watch the movie and identify a familiarity about the places and the people and the things they&#8217;re seeing, and people who aren&#8217;t familiar with it will gain some kind of understanding of what that world is like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kelly Marie Tran: &#8220;It&#8217;s really been a dream come true to work on something of this scale that says something as important as I think it says.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kelly Marie Tran (as Raya): &#8220;Now, to restore peace, I must find the last dragon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raya and the Last Dragon&#8221; hits theaters Friday and will also be available as a &#8220;Premier Access&#8221; selection on Disney Plus.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mad3 for M3 makes music just for you. They&#8217;re a Miami-based trio with a cool mix of styles, and fans are catching on to their sexy sounds. Deco caught up with the band to find out what makes Mad3 for M3 made for us.</p>
<p>The members of Mad3 for M3 &#8212; Kiddo, PJ and Alex &#8212; are all behind-the-scenes veterans of the SoFlo music scene.</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s their time to shine.</p>
<p>Kiddo: &#8220;We&#8217;re studio rats, so we&#8217;re in the studio all the time making music for other people, and this project is ours, so we called it Mad3 for M3, and there&#8217;s a three in there &#8217;cause there&#8217;s three of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their time making music for other acts came in handy when they decided to record their own material.</p>
<p>Kiddo: &#8220;The flow was great &#8217;cause we just have such a good energy together. It wasn&#8217;t that difficult &#8217;cause we&#8217;ve been working together for years, so we already had an idea of how we worked.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group has some mighty interesting musical tastes.</p>
<p>Pj McGinnis: &#8220;I&#8217;m a big fan of Jazz music, especially like &#8217;50s Jazz, so Miles Davis, John Coltrane, but I also like metal a lot, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Forget about nailing the band to any one particular style. They&#8217;re not having any of that.</p>
<p>Alex Coombs: &#8220;Our sound is pretty much a fusion &#8212; like pop fusion. We try to take from like a bunch of different genres and whatnot.&#8221;</p>
<p>You got that right. There&#8217;s the perfect pop of &#8220;More than Friends,&#8221; the Brazilian-flavored &#8220;By Your Side&#8221; or the dreamy dance track, &#8220;Josephine.&#8221;</p>
<p>We wanted to find out if Mad3 for M3 sounded as good live, as they do in the studio.</p>
<p>We got our answer &#8212; oh yes, they do.</p>
<p>Kiddo (singing): &#8220;I wanna take you on the other side and go further than we did tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>The music of Mad3 for M3 reflects their many influences.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why they love representing the 305.</p>
<p>Alex Coombs: &#8220;South Florida is such a melting pot of different cultures. People tend to not realize that music is actually an influx of life, and we just transfer it out through notes.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can catch the band in action Friday night at 9 p.m. inside Taima in Doral.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to shoes, who doesn&#8217;t need a new pair? A good shoe goes a really long way, and Deco&#8217;s checking out a local brand that&#8217;s always one step ahead.</p>
<p>If the shoe fits, show it off and rock it.</p>
<p>Voyetté Luxury Shoes, a local brand based out of the 305, wants you to slay all day in their sexy stilettos.</p>
<p>Voyetté Lee, Voyetté Luxury Shoes: &#8220;No one wants boring shoes. We want stylish, creative shoes, and we want something that&#8217;s gonna make us feel beautiful and alive and different.&#8221;</p>
<p>Voyetté Lee started designing shoes about two years ago.</p>
<p>Voyetté Lee: &#8220;I got started in this industry because I wanted to create luxury shoes at an affordable price. My shoes are for women who want to stand out, who want to make a fashion statement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Voyetté makes all kinds of fun kicks &#8212; from strappy sandals to blinged out pumps. Even the booties, they&#8217;re really cute.</p>
<p>Voyetté Lee: &#8220;I love creating shoes that stand out. I actually created a barbed wire heel. I thought it was really neat, and it was cool, and it was fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Celebs like Tyra Banks, Keyshia Cole, Blac Chyna and Keke Palmer love these heels. Even Vivica A. Fox had to get herself a pair.</p>
<p>Voyetté Lee: &#8220;When people wear my shoes, whether it&#8217;s a celebrity or whether it&#8217;s customers, I feel ecstatic. I feel complete.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of Voyetté best sellers is the Ohh Helen pump.</p>
<p>Voyetté Lee: &#8220;It&#8217;s a lace pump. It ties up around the leg, and it also has feathers in the back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another customer fave is the Latoy bootie.</p>
<p>Voyetté Lee: &#8220;That shoe is in the color nude and black. It has mesh, and it also comes with a crystal brooch on the side.&#8221;</p>
<p>Want a fun pop of color? You can&#8217;t go wrong with the Lady Liz pumps.</p>
<p>Voyetté Lee: &#8220;That shoe comes in green, and it also comes in a pumpkin spice orange. It has a metallic leather and a crystal strip.&#8221;</p>
<p>Voyetté has a shoe for every occasion, but she says it isn&#8217;t just about what you&#8217;re wearing. It&#8217;s how you feel in it.</p>
<p>Voyetté Lee: &#8220;I want them to feel alive. I want them to feel bold. I want them to feel empowerment when they wear my shoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that&#8217;s what I call a perfect fit.</p>
<p>Voyetté&#8217;s shoes start at $99. We checked them out at the SLS Hotel in Brickell.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You Dim Sum, you lose some, but when it comes to Asian vegan food, Deco&#8217;s checking out a new restaurant where everyone&#8217;s a winner &#8212; especially those trying to avoid the meat sweats.</p>
<p>It may look like traditional Dim Sum, but trust me, these dishes at Minty Z in Coconut Grove will have you in your &#8220;fillings.&#8221;</p>
<p>This new pan-Asian restaurant is all about shareable plates, but it&#8217;s what&#8217;s not on the menu that&#8217;s got everyone talking.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right. Everything at Minty Z is 100% vegan.</p>
<p>Minty Zhu, Minty Z: &#8220;Here in South Florida, there&#8217;s not a lot of vegan Asian options. We have over 20 dishes, including vegan Dim Sum and other creative dishes.&#8221;</p>
<p>This couple is getting crafty in the kitchen and using things like black sesame, jackfruit and corn instead of meat.</p>
<p>Alexander Falco, Minty Z: &#8220;A lot of our inspiration came from the food that we make at home, with us both being vegans.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the restaurant&#8217;s signature items is the barbecue jackfruit lo mai gai. This dish uses shredded jackfruit, which has a similar texture to pulled pork.</p>
<p>Alexander Falco: &#8220;We make it in a sort of homemade barbecue sauce. It&#8217;s a sticky rice dumpling wrapped around the barbecue jackfruit filling and steamed inside a lotus leaf.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ace, customer: &#8220;It was so good that I actually ate some of the leaf around it, too, and you&#8217;re not supposed to eat that part.&#8221;</p>
<p>Check out those buns! Bao buns, that is.</p>
<p>This fun snack has a carrot-flavored dough and is filled with black sesame paste that&#8217;s almost like peanut butter.</p>
<p>Alexander Falco: &#8220;We sear them on the bottom, and we serve that with a homemade coconut yogurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing corny about Minty Z&#8217;s Cuban corn wontons.</p>
<p>Alexander Falco: &#8220;We use vegan ham, garlic, cumin, cilantro all in the filling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once the wontons are shaped, they head to the fryer to get golden brown, and for dipping, a tofu based lime mayo!</p>
<p>Ace: &#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to eat more vegan, but I haven&#8217;t found anything that I&#8217;ve really liked, but now that I came here and I&#8217;ve tried this, I think I&#8217;ll definitely be coming back.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some of our favorite spots in town are still closed, but one of them is making an amazing comeback! Wynwood Marketplace is getting ready to reopen tomorrow, but Deco&#8217;s taking you inside tonight.</p>
<p>New year, new Wynwood Marketplace.</p>
<p>This SoFlo hot spot is back in business after being closed for almost a year.</p>
<p>Sarah Caceres, Wynwood Marketplace: &#8220;We&#8217;re just thrilled to have our family back together and welcome everyone back to Wynwood to visit the Wynwood Marketplace.&#8221;</p>
<p>This place is a huge outside oasis where you can shop, eat, drink and be merry.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, it used to look like this, but the space has undergone a total transformation.</p>
<p>Sarah Caceres: &#8220;You&#8217;re gonna see all kinds of shops, photo murals. We have photo ops inside the venue, all kinds of restaurants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Revamping means Wynwood Marketplace was also able to expand its sitting area.</p>
<p>Sarah Caceres: &#8220;Now with the remodel, we have over 100 tables, and everyone is a VIP.&#8221;</p>
<p>VIP treatment equals no standing around and waiting.</p>
<p>Your food and drinks now come to you.</p>
<p>Sarah Caceres: &#8220;You can order right from your table from a QR code.&#8221;</p>
<p>Want to celebrate the grand reopening with something special? Go with the WMP Burger.</p>
<p>Sarah Caceres: &#8220;You&#8217;ll only find it here. It has a special secret sauce, fried egg, melted cheddar cheese, nicely toasted. It&#8217;s delicious.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also yummy al pastor tacos, and to wash it all down&#8230;</p>
<p>Sarah Caceres: &#8220;One of my favorite drinks that we have here is the spicy guava margarita. All fresh, fresh guava, fresh jalapeno, fresh lime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another option: a refreshing summertime mule!</p>
<p>Sarah Caceres: &#8220;Basically, your classic Moscow Mule, but with a twist of fresh strawberry and rosemary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve gotten your fill, it&#8217;s time to walk it off and shop &#8217;til you drop!</p>
<p>Sarah Caceres: &#8220;We have over 40 local artisanal vendors here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wynwood Marketplace converted shipping containers into individual mini shops, and you&#8217;ll find everything from T-shirts and house plants to psychic readings.</p>
<p>Sarah Caceres: &#8220;It&#8217;s a really cool place to come and spend your afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sebastian Zeledon, guest: &#8220;I love the new Wynwood Marketplace. I love how the environment is. It&#8217;s, like, more fitting for Wynwood and stuff. It&#8217;s super exciting.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in high school, the biggest dilemma I had was which boy to kiss and which blue eye shadow to use.</p>
<p>But some teens have a little more pressure these days.</p>
<p>A promising athlete shoots for the stars in the new film &#8220;Boogie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taylor Takahashi (as Boogie): &#8220;No one believes in an Asian basketball player.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alfred &#8220;Boogie&#8221; Chin is a basketball star with hoop dreams.</p>
<p>But before he can become a pro baller, Boogie has to balance school, stereotypes, his heritage, and family.</p>
<p>Taylor Takahashi (as Boogie): &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to know what is going on in my house. My mom is responsible but she doesn&#8217;t believe in me. My dad is irresponsible but he believes in me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taylor Takahashi is the teen sports phenom in &#8220;Boogie.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the court, he sinks buckets. Off the court is another story!</p>
<p>Taylor Takahashi: &#8220;&#8216;Boogie&#8217; is a coming of age story, coming from an immigrant Taiwanese American family and its the journey through his lens. Basketball is a big part of it, adolescence and the whole high school journey is also a part of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard of Taylor, that&#8217;s because this was his first movie! No pressure, right?</p>
<p>Taylor Takahashi: &#8220;There was a lot of nerves and a lot of anxiety that went into it. I am glad I didn&#8217;t have to wear a heart rate monitor on a daily basis because they probably would have thought I had a heart attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taylour Paige (as Eleanor): &#8220;I need you to fight for yourself the same way you fight for being Chinese.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah, teen love!</p>
<p>Eleanor is Boogie&#8217;s girlfriend, biggest cheerleader, and sometimes a distraction.</p>
<p>Taylour Paige: &#8220;They are young and there is that teenage angst, attraction and connection.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Taylour Paige, girl power is just what boogie needs.</p>
<p>Taylour Page: &#8220;I think she brings a feminine understanding. I think Eleanor grounds the story with the divine feminine element. And girls are always a little more mature than their male counterparts, especially at that age.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eddie Huang plays Boogie&#8217;s uncle Jackie. He&#8217;s a triple threat &#8212; he wrote and directed the movie, too.</p>
<p>Eddie Huang: &#8220;It&#8217;s very hard to wear all those hats. I would love to act again but probably not while directing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Note to self: Stick with one job, do it well, and it will be a slam dunk!</p>
<p>Jorge Lendeborg Jr. (as Richie): &#8220;This has always been about you. What are you going to do?&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Coming 2 America&#8221; has been coming here for a really long time!</p>
<p>Yeah, we&#8217;ve waited more than 30 years for a sequel to the &#8217;80s classic comedy. And it means a lot to the new cast members starring in it!</p>
<p>Failed Disney cast member Alex Miranda has more.</p>
<p>Lynn and Shireen, 33 years is almost as long as it takes to get a vaccine these days. But for &#8220;Coming 2 America,&#8221; it&#8217;s worth the wait too!</p>
<p>Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall, plus about a thousand other celebrities, make this the double dose of laughter we need in 2021.</p>
<p>The beloved &#8220;Coming 2 America&#8221; took way <em>too</em> long to come back!</p>
<p>33 whole years! So can you believe we still have to wait until Friday??</p>
<p>Teyana Taylor: &#8220;Oh, my God. I don&#8217;t know, like&#8230; The feeling is just like jitters!&#8221;</p>
<p>In the sequel, Prince Akeem becomes King of Zamunda! But it turns out, he has a long long son back in the States!</p>
<p>Jermaine Fowler (as Lavelle Junson): &#8220;I don&#8217;t need no handout! Wait a minute&#8230; I&#8217;m going to pack!&#8221;</p>
<p>So Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall&#8217;s Semmi fly back to Queens, New York to meet Lavelle, played by Jermaine Fowler.</p>
<p>Jermaine Fowler: &#8220;It does what the original does so well, which is tell a good story, an original story, and I think this one does such a great job of appeasing the older fans and some of the new ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>But for Tracy Morgan, this star-studded comedy spectacle is arriving at just the right time.</p>
<p>Tracy Morgan: &#8220;It&#8217;s a gift for the world right now, especially in these times.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tracy tells Deco, the original meant everything for him back in 1988.</p>
<p>Tracy Morgan: &#8220;I used to go to the movies a lot with my dad, but he died when I was 19. So 20 I went to see it. My father would have loved that movie, because my father was a big Eddie Murphy fan.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that it helped him through that tragic loss.</p>
<p>Tracy Morgan: &#8220;Akeem&#8217;s relationship with his father, the king, reminded me of my dad. So it was emotional for me to see it. So to be cast in part two, my dad is in Heaven doing this.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Teyana Taylor admitted, she watched it as a kid, over and over again!</p>
<p>Teyana Taylor: &#8220;Looking back at it, being grown — I&#8217;m 30 years old — I&#8217;m still to this day watching it not realizing half of what was really going down. So that&#8217;s how I knew for a fact I had no business watching it.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it just made it all the more surreal on the set.</p>
<p>Teyana Taylor: &#8220;I really fangirled a lot because it was really like, &#8216;Oh, my God, you doing this?? You doing that??'&#8221;</p>
<p>And it looks like Jermaine is already getting the royal treatment.</p>
<p>Jermaine Fowler: &#8220;&#8216;What up, Prince?!&#8217; I had that a couple days ago. And I was like, &#8216;Ahh, shucks!'&#8221;</p>
<p>And even though he&#8217;s not affected by the fame&#8230;</p>
<p>Jermaine Fowler: &#8220;My cat act&#8217;s different. It acts entitled. Like, come on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming 2 America&#8221; hits Amazon Prime video this Friday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring is just around the corner, and you know what that means: more people will be hitting the beach, so if you wanna be a step ahead of the fashion game, listen up! Deco&#8217;s checking out a swimsuit trend that&#8217;ll have you all ruffled up.</p>
<p>A little extra fabric never looked cuter!</p>
<p>When it comes to swimwear, less isn&#8217;t more anymore.</p>
<p>Ruffles are making waves as one of the hottest style trends.</p>
<p>Stefanie Holtzheuser, Jypsea Local: &#8220;I really love playing with ruffles because I think it adds a feminine touch to any suit.&#8221;</p>
<p>SoFlo luxury brand Jypsea Local has a new store in Fort Lauderdale, ad they&#8217;re here to help you make a splash.</p>
<p>Stefanie Holtzheuser: &#8220;Jypsea local is primarily a swimwear brand, and we also specialize in ath-leisure wear and making women feel beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jypsea Local is all about bright colors and fun prints, and ruffles are the perfect way to take any suit to the next level.</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s a one-piece&#8230;</p>
<p>Stefanie Holtzheuser: &#8220;A plunging neckline one piece with an open back and ruffles on the hips to accentuate curves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or a bikini with tons of versatility&#8230;</p>
<p>Stefanie Holtzheuser: &#8220;You can pull up the strings on the bottom and make it more of a high cut, and then, you can also pull up the ruffles on the top to sit on the shoulder, or pull it off the shoulder for an off the shoulder look.&#8221;</p>
<p>Need more proof ruffles are hot, hot, hot?</p>
<p>Celebs like Rita Ora, January Jones, Nicole Scherzinger and Sarah Michelle Geller can&#8217;t get enough of &#8217;em.</p>
<p>Stefanie Holtzheuser: &#8220;I think it kinda gives us an excuse to play and get back to our playful side. Get out in the sun, accessorize and, you know, have a fun suit that&#8217;s a little bit more flirty.&#8221;</p>
<p>The best part is Jypsea swimsuits are also durable because they&#8217;re made for the girl on the go.</p>
<p>Stefanie Holtzheuser: &#8220;Our suits are made for girls who are active. We use two to three layers of fabric.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meaning you won&#8217;t just look good wearing them, you&#8217;ll feel fab too!</p>
<p>Stefanie Holtzheuser: &#8220;You will feel like a queen!&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Concerts! Remember those?!</p>
<p>Guess what? They&#8217;re slowly but surely coming back, just on a smaller, more COVID-friendly scale.</p>
<p>But CeeLo Green says big or small, he&#8217;ll rock any venue.</p>
<p>The singer is dishing with Deco about his upcoming performance on Miami Beach.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re seeing green this weekend&#8230; CeeLo Green!</p>
<p>CeeLo Green: &#8220;I see you driving &#8217;round town with the girl I love and I&#8217;m like forget you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The singer is bringing his sweet sounds to the Fontainebleau&#8217;s BleauLive concert venue this Saturday.</p>
<p>CeeLo Green: &#8220;I&#8217;m only scheduled to be there a couple days for the performance, but you know, c&#8217;mon man, I think I might end up staying a week or two weeks, I don&#8217;t know. I always say any excuse to come to Miami.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what we like to hear!</p>
<p>CeeLo recently performed for a small live audience at the Soul Train Awards, and he&#8217;s itching to connect with his fans a little more.</p>
<p>CeeLo Green: &#8220;I think artists get a little self-absorbed. and you forget that that is the inception of all of this. That is the origin, that is the point — to be of service to the listening public and to the people.&#8221;</p>
<p>This weekend&#8217;s concert is gonna be intimate, inside the Fontaine Ballroom. After all, there&#8217;s still a pandemic going on.</p>
<p>Josh Herman, Fontainebleau vice president of marketing: &#8220;Everybody that comes to the Fontainebleau gets a temperature check. All the seating at the show is tables only, so everything is spaced out, six feet from the closest guest. Mask usage is enforced.&#8221;</p>
<p>That all sounds good to CeeLo!</p>
<p>CeeLo Green: &#8220;There&#8217;s no stage too big or no room too small. I can fit in there! And I like smaller rooms, smaller venues too, because for those who want to gather around and really enjoy themselves and have a good time, we&#8217;ve gotta make it special for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>And one way to make it special is by CeeLo giving his 305 fans a whole range of his music.</p>
<p>He may be best known for older singles like &#8220;Forget You&#8221; and &#8220;Crazy&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>CeeLo Green: &#8220;Does that make me crazy?&#8221;</p>
<p>But he also released a new album during COVID.</p>
<p>CeeLo Green: &#8220;I&#8217;m going, going down with the sun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fans can expect to hear a little of it all on Saturday.</p>
<p>CeeLo Green: &#8220;This performance will be a kind of like Cee-Lo Green Pandora&#8217;s station. I think people will enjoy going A to Z with CeeLo Green.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is actually Bleaulive&#8217;s first show back since the shutdown. Tickets are obviously limited.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do Drake, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and Tom Cruise all have in common? What they wake up on top of &#8230; but this isn&#8217;t like what you buy at a regular mattress store. Alex Miranda, a mattress connoisseur of sorts, is in Miami&#8217;s Design District with the story.</p>
<p>Drake (rapping): &#8220;I only love my bed and my mom, I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, now we know why.</p>
<p>Juan Quintero, Hästens: &#8220;We have beds for $50,000, $200,000, $400,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>They say Hästens makes the best mattresses in the world.</p>
<p>Juan Quintero: &#8220;The most recent celebrity we made a bed for was for Drake. I think it was over $400,000. It was specially customized for him. There is also Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt.&#8221;</p>
<p>At their new showroom, Sleep Spa, in Miami&#8217;s Design District, you can take a test drive.</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;Oooh, oh, wow! All right, you know what? I think I like it firm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juan Quintero: &#8220;We dim the lights for them, and we just tuck them in bed, literally.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, they will literally lock the front door. You can sleep for 30 minutes, 45, even an hour.</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;Yeah, we&#8217;ll talk later. I&#8217;m going to take a nap.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all COVID-safe, too. Just bring your PJs, or they&#8217;ll sell you some.</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;Take a look at these boots! I&#8217;m obsessed, and I guess I&#8217;m already sold before I&#8217;ve even started. Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>Buuuuuut, what&#8217;s all the fuss about anyway?</p>
<p>Juan Quintero: &#8220;Our beds will remove the static from you, but it also absorbs the moisture and the heat, and gives you a proper anatomic alignment.&#8221;</p>
<p>And they&#8217;re really comfy! Plus, the all-natural materials include ethically-sourced horse hair, so it&#8217;s totally cool to horse around.</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;Yee-haw!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hästens also sells queen mattresses for as &#8220;low&#8221; as $7,000. The Vividus is not one of them.</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;This is $210,000! They call it the Bugatti &#8212; oh, yeah! OK, here it is! &#8212; of mattresses.&#8221;</p>
<p>You might have also seen it in &#8220;Emily in Paris,&#8221; but I call this scene &#8220;Alex in Heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;I really don&#8217;t know how Drake gets up in the morning. I mean, you get into this thing, and you just sink. It puts you to sleep like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just, uh, don&#8217;t forget to set the alarm.</p>
<p>Alex: &#8220;Where am I? What time is it? What happened? Why am I in a store?!&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Someone call Doc Brown and Marty McFly, because we are about to go back to the future. We don&#8217;t need a time-traveling DeLorean; we just need to head to Miami. There&#8217;s a brand-new pop-up that&#8217;s a flashback to one of Miami&#8217;s original hot spots, and it&#8217;s staying true to its roots.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s old is new again.</p>
<p>Tobacco Road is back. Sort of.</p>
<p>Matthew &#8220;Kush&#8221; Kuscher: &#8220;This is just a tribute to the greatest dive bar in Miami history.&#8221;</p>
<p>The guys behind Kush Wynwood and Spillover teamed up with some of Tobacco Road&#8217;s original owners to create a pop-up called Tobacco Road by Kush.</p>
<p>Matthew &#8220;Kush&#8221; Kuscher: &#8220;We are doing making a museum version of the Tobacco Road that you remember.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christina Cernuda: &#8220;I&#8217;m experiencing something that&#8217;s a blast from the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tobacco Road was the oldest bar in Miami when it closed in 2014.</p>
<p>Well, now it&#8217;s got new life.</p>
<p>Matthew &#8220;Kush&#8221; Kuscher: &#8220;To me, doing a tribute to this is a no-brainer. Why wouldn&#8217;t I want to be a part of the greatest dive bar in Miami history? It&#8217;s what I love about this city, is bringing out the best culture and what it is and just bringing back that stuff so we don&#8217;t forget about the good stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pop-up is in Brickell and just down the street from the original Tobacco Road.</p>
<p>And this new edition is pretty close to the original.</p>
<p>Matthew &#8220;Kush&#8221; Kuscher: &#8220;We like to say we blacked out, woke up six years later and two doors down, and that&#8217;s where the original location is. Since we partnered up with the original owners, we actually got all the memorabilia, so we got the original signage and all the fun stuff that decorated the walls all those years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cristina Cernuda: &#8220;I think the décor is spot on. A lot of the original signage is gorgeous. I love the neon and all of the photography of the bands. I think it really does it justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be a bar without booze.</p>
<p>Matthew &#8220;Kush&#8221; Kuscher: &#8220;We also have some dive bar chic cocktails.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, the drinks have Miami flair and flavors, like guava and jalapeño.</p>
<p>Even the menu got a makeover. But they stayed true to the classics.</p>
<p>Tobacco Road&#8217;s Death Burger has been brought back to life.</p>
<p>Matthew &#8220;Kush&#8221; Kuscher: &#8220;I had to work with the owners to make sure we perfected the essence of what it was and what it is now, and we got the two thumbs up from them, so I&#8217;m really happy about that one.&#8221;</p>
<p>They haven&#8217;t decided how long the pop-up will be in town, so, in other words&#8230;</p>
<p>Matthew &#8220;Kush&#8221; Kuscher: &#8220;If you want to go to the greatest bar in Miami, why wouldn&#8217;t you want to check it out? Come on, we are waiting for you.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We look forward to this every year: awards season! It&#8217;s so much fun watching celebrities shower themselves with praise &#8230; like what&#8217;s going to be happening this Sunday at the Golden Globes. Here&#8217;s a preview from Deco&#8217;s global correspondent and body piercing enthusiast, Alex Miranda.</p>
<p>Things are working a little bit differently in 2021, but the star power is just as big, the controversies are still there over certain nominations (&#8220;Emily in Paris&#8221;), and as you&#8217;ll see, there&#8217;s one snub we at Deco just can&#8217;t get over.</p>
<p>The Golden Globes are Sunday Night, but Fandango&#8217;s Nikki Novak tells Deco to expect things to be, well, all 2021 this year.</p>
<p>Alex: &#8220;The Golden Globes are going to be virtual. How do you think these award shows are adjusting, translating to this new medium?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nikki Novak, Fandango: &#8220;Tina and Amy are co-hosting from different ends of the countr. They&#8217;re not even going to be together, and they&#8217;re so good together. They&#8217;re so used to playing off of each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler do have their work cut out for them, but so does the Hollywood Foreign Press.</p>
<p>Nikki Novak: &#8220;Best Picture [Drama], people are saying it&#8217;s between &#8216;The Trial of the Chicago 7&#8217; and &#8216;Nomadland.'&#8221;</p>
<p>As far as a Comedy or Musical films&#8230;</p>
<p>Nikki Novak: &#8220;It looks like &#8216;Borat&#8217; is the favorite, and &#8216;Hamilton&#8217; may be the close second. I&#8217;m predicting it&#8217;s going to be &#8216;Hamilton.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Nikki says Best Actor is a shoo-in.</p>
<p>Nikki Novak: &#8220;I think we&#8217;re going to see Chadwick Boseman win for &#8216;Ma Rainey&#8217;s Black Bottom.&#8217; Obviously, the tragedy that happened last year with his passing.&#8221;</p>
<p>And for Actress, it&#8217;s a toss-up.</p>
<p>Nikki Novak: &#8220;You have Viola Davis, who&#8217;s the front-runner, but you also have Carey Mulligan for &#8216;Promising Young Woman,&#8217; that people are saying could upset.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over on the TV side, though&#8230;</p>
<p>Nikki Novak: &#8220;For TV Drama, I really think this is going to be &#8216;The Crown&#8217;s&#8217; year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Musical or Comedy could get funny.</p>
<p>Nikki Novak: &#8216;Schitt&#8217;s Creek&#8217; won at the Emmys, and it is the front-runner. However, &#8216;Ted Lasso&#8217; has such a following.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;Do you think that &#8216;Emily in Paris&#8217; was worthy of a nomination?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nikki Novak: &#8220;They&#8217;re not afraid to award something that people have generally liked. I always go back to years ago, when Julia Roberts was nominated for &#8216;Pretty Woman&#8217; for an Oscar, and people kind of went, &#8216;What?'&#8221;</p>
<p>And speaking of&#8230;</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;Did you find that anything got snubbed?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nikki Novak: &#8220;Lynn and Shireen did not get nominated. This, to me, was just such an omission on the part of the Hollywood Foreign Press.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearly our pick for Best Picture-Perfect Co-Hosts.</p>
<p>Nikki Novak: &#8220;But I predict that next year, Lynn and Shireen will be co-hosting the Golden Globe Awards.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three women are nominated for Best Director his year: Regina King, Chloé Zhao and Emerald Fennell. It is the first time more than one woman has been nominated in the category.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A literal game of cat and mouse, drugs and Spider-Man committing crimes. Those things may or may not be related. Find out in this week&#8217;s Showtime.</p>
<p>Animated frenemies Tom and Jerry are at each other&#8217;s throats again, this time at New York&#8217;s finest hotel.</p>
<p>Chloë Grace Moretz stars as an event planner trying to save the wedding of the year before the cat and mouse destroy it.</p>
<p>Chloë Grace Moretz: &#8220;She thinks hiring Tom will be a good way to get rid of Jerry. Little does she know, they go way back, and she&#8217;s way in over her head on so many levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>In &#8220;The United States vs. Billie Holiday,&#8221; the feds launch an undercover sting operation against the legendary jazz singer &#8212; how dare they! &#8212; after she becomes a powerful voice for the civil rights movement.</p>
<p>Andra Day: &#8220;She is truly the godmother of civil rights, who did now die because she was a tragic drug addict, but her life was slowly siphoned from her intentionally.&#8221;</p>
<p>Character in &#8220;Crisis&#8221;: &#8220;There is no greater scourge facing American from within. The President takes the opioid crisis very seriously.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pure chaos in the new crime thriller &#8220;Crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>The film, starring Gary Oldman, Evangeline Lilly and Armie Hammer, follows three connected storylines, all involving drugs. Definitely not a comedy.</p>
<p>Tim Holland (as &#8220;Cherry&#8221;): &#8220;I don&#8217;t imagine that anyone goes in for a robbery if they&#8217;re not in some kind of desperation. I&#8217;ve been at this a while now, and it&#8217;s no secret what my face looks like.&#8221;</p>
<p>From stopping crimes as Spider-Man to committing them in &#8220;Cherry,&#8221; Tom Holland is tapping into a darker side in the Apple TV Plus drama.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s a war veteran who comes home with post-traumatic stress disorder, gets addicted to drugs and starts robbing banks.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a role that truly pushed the actor.</p>
<p>Tom Holland: &#8220;The worst-case scenario is when you have a really physically emotional day, and you wake up, and you&#8217;re just a waste of yourself.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beer gardens are a time a dozen. It&#8217;s a place where you can chill outdoors, grab a drink and enjoy some music, but a tequila garden? Now that&#8217;s worth drinking to. Deco&#8217;s checking out a brand new, one-of-a-kind spot in the 305.</p>
<p>Bottoms up, SoFlo!</p>
<p>Pilo&#8217;s Tequila Garden is setting up shop in Wynwood, and it&#8217;s unlike any place you&#8217;ve been to before.</p>
<p>Derek Gonzalez, Pilo&#8217;s Tequila Garden: &#8220;The tequila garden concept&#8217;s extremely unique, not just for Miami, but for the world. It&#8217;s the first of it&#8217;s kind, doesn&#8217;t exist, never been done.&#8221;</p>
<p>What makes this place so different is that it&#8217;s more than just a Mexican restaurant or bar.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like a beer garden, except with tequila.</p>
<p>Derek Gonzalez: &#8220;It&#8217;s our culture. It&#8217;s our DNA, where we collaborate with music, entertainment and food. It&#8217;s a combination of all that in an outdoor space &#8212; indoor and outdoor, mostly outdoor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pilo&#8217;s first made waves in Brickell with their taco shop, and they&#8217;re definitely bringing their street food and flair to the tequila garden.</p>
<p>Derek Gonzalez: &#8220;The food menu consists of basically Mexico&#8217;s greatest hits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tacos is the name of the game, and these guys know what they&#8217;re doing!</p>
<p>Derek Gonzalez: &#8220;The best one, hands down, is <em>la pilo</em>, which is an al pastor taco.&#8221;</p>
<p>This one starts off with sliced pork, throw it on the grill with some tortillas and top it with cilantro, white onions and pineapple.</p>
<p>Another customer fave is the fish taco.</p>
<p>Derek Gonzalez: &#8220;The fish taco has it all, it really has. It has the best fish. It&#8217;s haddock, white, flaky.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fish is fried until golden and served with <em>pico de gallo</em>, pineapple, red cabbage and a spicy sauce.</p>
<p>Alexia, customer: &#8220;I ordered <em>El Pescadito</em>. It&#8217;s a fish taco, fresh, really, really good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve covered the food, let&#8217;s talk about the booze!</p>
<p>Because when the word &#8220;tequila&#8221; is in your name, you know you gotta have the good stuff.</p>
<p>Derek Gonzalez: &#8220;If you&#8217;re gonna have the only tequila garden in the world right now, you gotta have the best margarita in the world, so we have the pilorita. Another one that I really love is the mamadita, which has a Popsicle almost like a creamsicle daiquiri &#8212; delicious, delicious.&#8221;</p>
<p>Add some live entertainment to the mix, and you&#8217;ve got everything you need to have a good night.</p>
<p>Cheers to that!</p>
<p>Alexia: &#8220;This is, I think, the best place to get the best tequila drinks.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tom Holland is Mr. Marvel Sequels, but Spider-Guy isn&#8217;t so marvel-ous in his gritty new movie, &#8220;Cherry.&#8221; Don&#8217;t ya just know, that little charmer says he still had a good time on set. That&#8217;s why he&#8217;s our Spider-Guy.</p>
<p>You know him as that friendly neighborhood, web-slinging superhero.</p>
<p>Tom Holland (as Peter Parker): &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re using your name up names. Um, I&#8217;m Spider-Man, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>But these days. Tom Holland is tapping into a darker side.</p>
<p>Tom Holland (as &#8220;Cherry&#8221;): &#8220;I&#8217;m 23 years old, and sometimes I wonder if life was wasted on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom stars in &#8220;Cherry,&#8221; a new drama that&#8217;ll stream on Apple TV Plus. He&#8217;s a war veteran who comes home with post-traumatic stress disorder, gets addicted to drugs and starts robbing banks.</p>
<p>Tom Holland (as &#8220;Cherry&#8221;): &#8220;I don&#8217;t imagine that anyone goes in for a robbery if they&#8217;re not in some kind of desperation.&#8221;</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the thing: the movie never actually says his name.</p>
<p>Tom Holland: &#8220;It was slightly complicated trying to figure out how to play a character that didn&#8217;t have a name.&#8221;</p>
<p>It may have been challenging, but it was also kind of liberating.</p>
<p>Tom Holland: &#8220;It allowed me to have this creative freedom to portray as many people as I could. He represents millions of people that are suffering.&#8221;</p>
<p>Things go from bad to worse for &#8220;Cherry,&#8221; if that&#8217;s his name, and he sort of spirals.</p>
<p>Tom says people need to know it&#8217;s OK to ask for help, no matter what they&#8217;re going through.</p>
<p>Tom Holland: &#8220;Seeking help is a very honorable thing to do and something you should be very proud of.&#8221;</p>
<p>The movie is heavy, but Tom never felt weighed down on set.</p>
<p>Tom Holland: &#8220;Even when we were shooting some of the hardest scenes, the most emotional scenes, there were always times when we were joking and having a good time and enjoying ourselves, because making films is fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom is only 24 years old, but he&#8217;s used to pushing himself to the limit for work &#8212; both physically, like in the &#8220;Spider-Man&#8221; movies, and in &#8220;Cherry&#8217;s&#8221; case, emotionally.</p>
<p>Tom Holland (as &#8220;Cherry&#8221;): &#8220;I have this noise in my head.&#8221;</p>
<p>But is one harder than the other?</p>
<p>Tom Holland: &#8220;If you have a really hard physical day, you wake up the next day and you&#8217;re sore, and if you have a really difficult emotional day, you wake up the next day, and you feel drained, but I definitely say an emotional day is far more tiring than a physical day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Holland (as &#8220;Cherry&#8221;): &#8220;Sometimes I feel like I&#8217;ve already seen everything that&#8217;s gonna happen, and it&#8217;s a nightmare.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cherry&#8221; hits Apple TV Plus on March 12, but if you can&#8217;t wait until then, it&#8217;s also coming out in select theaters on Friday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to COVID, it&#8217;s been a while since most of us have been to a food festival, but that&#8217;s about to change. There&#8217;s a new foodie event coming to town that&#8217;ll have you wondering why you wasted energy walking around other festivals in the past.</p>
<p>Fill&#8217;er up!</p>
<p>Vanessa Leitman, Resy: &#8220;Resy drive-thru Miami is a 10 course tasting menu enjoyed from the comfort of your car.&#8221;</p>
<p>On March 18 and 19, Resy drive-thru will give hungry South Floridians a taste of the food festivals they know and love &#8212; socially distanced of course.</p>
<p>Vanessa Leitman: &#8220;There is 10 different restaurants that will have tents. Each restaurant is creating one dish, and guests all have waiter that will walk beside their car and take them through the entire experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Resy joined forces with American Express for the drive-thru in Miami, which will be going down at 1 Herald Plaza, and they&#8217;ll be serving more than food.</p>
<p>Vanessa Leitman: &#8220;There is a playlist with the chef that is talking to you about what you are eating. You are listening to music. Visually, there is other stuff going on outside of the car, so there is some entertainment going on as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Resy is an app that links hungry diners to local restaurants, so they know good eats!</p>
<p>Vanessa Leitman: &#8220;We really tried to make sure it was a cohesive menu, things that are reflective of South Florida and Miami, but really showing the best restaurants in Miami in an entirely new way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Local favs like Planta and Osaka will be there.</p>
<p>Juan Urutia, Osaka: &#8220;It&#8217;s a great opportunity to show our food, our textures, our flavors to the Miami community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Osaka is known for their international flavors and their tuna ceviche won&#8217;t disappoint.</p>
<p>Juan Urutia: &#8220;It&#8217;s a perfect mix between Japanese techniques and the Peruvian flavors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Planta&#8217;s Resy course will get your motor running.</p>
<p>Steven Salm, Planta: &#8220;We&#8217;re serving an incredible sushi box with an ahi, watermelon nagri, a dragon roll with avocado and spicy unagi, and an avocado torched and pressed with miso and truffle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tickets for the dine and drive event are $110 per person.</p>
<p>Vanessa Leitman: &#8220;It&#8217;s a really, really cool, interesting way to experience food, to interact with the favorite restaurants and chefs that you love in just this really sort of new COVID-friendly way.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to Lynn&#8217;s favorite things to eat, comfort food is the way to go. Shireen too, give her a burger and fries any day. Speaking of hunks of beef, Deco&#8217;s Alex Miranda has a meal so big, you might have a cow. Do you have a big meal, Alex?</p>
<p>My favorite F-words words are food, friends and fun, and there is a spot in Wynwood that is combining all three of these things.</p>
<p>All you need to bring is your appetite.</p>
<p>Size matters at the Butcher Shop Beer Garden &amp; Grill in Wynwood.</p>
<p>Their massive burger will make all other burgers jealous!</p>
<p>Nicole Reyes, The Butcher Shop Garden &amp; Grill: &#8220;The Deluxe Fat Freddie Burger is an experience we offer here at the Butcher Shop.&#8221;</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to ask where&#8217;s the beef, you can&#8217;t miss it!</p>
<p>A 5-pound beef patty is topped with cheese, brisket and even fried mac &#8216;n&#8217; cheese.</p>
<p>Nicole Reyes: &#8220;The mac &#8216;n&#8217; cheese bombs explode in your mouth, and you get to that smoked brisket flavor. You can&#8217;t beat this type of product.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget the lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and their secret sauce.</p>
<p>Giselle Santiago, customer: &#8220;It tastes like heaven. It&#8217;s like so many tastes I didn&#8217;t expect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hope you want fries with that.</p>
<p>Nicole Reyes: &#8220;This burger comes with truffle golden flake fries as well as a 3-liter tower of beer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Fat Freddie feeds six to 10 people, and the Butcher Shop&#8217;s beer garden is the perfect place for some socially distanced sharing.</p>
<p>Nicole Reyes: &#8220;This burger comes served on a platter. We bring it out with sparklers. We cut it at the table and serve with your side of fries as well as pour your beer.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Giselle and her pals, this huge hamburger hits the spot.</p>
<p>Giselle Santiago: &#8220;It&#8217;s a great dish to share amongst friends. Everyone is going to be happy because it&#8217;s delicious, and it&#8217;s enough for everyone, more than enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Deluxe Fat Freddie is $200 of Grade-A goodness.</p>
<p>Nicole Reyes: &#8220;You can come in and order this on the spot as a regular burger. It takes up to 30 minutes to produce, and we bring the show to your table.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you are counting your calories, you can get the Fat Freddie without the fries and beer, and if you need a friend to help you eat it, give me a call.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In honor of Black History Month, local designer David Castro&#8217;s line DungeonForward created something that&#8217;s heads above the rest, and it&#8217;s so good, you&#8217;ll wanna leave your hat on.</p>
<p>In fact, SoFlo celebs love em&#8217;. Jason Derulo and former Miami Heat star Dwyane Wade are big fans of DungeonForward.</p>
<p>This month, the company teamed up with four artists to create a limited-edition capsule collection called Black Artist Collective.</p>
<p>David Castro, DungeonForward: &#8220;I think we created something that far exceeds what could have been done by one individual.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you like it, buy it. Only a limited number of hats were made, so once they&#8217;re gone, you&#8217;ll only see them on the heads of people who were quicker than you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can always count on people to find a silver lining, even in a pandemic. When some women couldn&#8217;t get to their hairstylists because of COVID, they gave rise to a new trend: natural hair.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just not easy getting hair like Beyonce, Kelly Rowland or Cardi B, especially during a pandemic!</p>
<p>Good thing &#8220;hairs&#8221; a new trend growing &#8212; the natural look.</p>
<p>Simone Hylton, hair stylist, Natural Trendsetters: &#8220;Natural hair is hair in its original state, hair that&#8217;s not chemically treated. I think it&#8217;s really trending now because of COVID, a lot of people were forced to stop using chemicals with not being able to attend the salons.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alicia Keys is all about going au naturale as you can see in her music video &#8220;In Common,&#8221; but she&#8217;s not the only one.</p>
<p>Simone Hylton: &#8220;Gabrielle Union&#8217;s going natural. Taraji P. Henson, she actually has a line she just came out with. Viola Davis wears her hair natural. A lot of celebrities are wearing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>And thanks to Simone Hylton from Natural Trendsetters in Tamarac, you can say bye-bye to hair chemicals, too.</p>
<p>Simone Hylton: &#8220;We don&#8217;t just help people heal their hair to go natural. We help them to treat it, style it and really get the best results that they can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ariel Imas, customer: &#8220;I just love having natural hair that&#8217;s not chemically processed. It&#8217;s healthier. It grows longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether you wear long braids, the two strand twists, curly hair, bantu knots or locs (locks), you&#8217;ll never get tired of the look.</p>
<p>Simone Hylton: &#8220;It&#8217;s different textures, so one technique on every style looks different. It just gives you a little more freedom.&#8221;</p>
<p>And your hair will love you for it.</p>
<p>Simone Hylton: &#8220;It&#8217;s the healthiest way to wear your hair.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine living in a world where you can hear everything a man thinks.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty good to me!</p>
<p>But apparently, it&#8217;s a bad thing in the new sci-fi adventure movie, &#8220;Chaos Walking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speed walker, Alex Miranda, has the story.</p>
<p>Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland star in the new action-packed movie based on the popular book trilogy.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s get back to that whole men&#8217;s thoughts thing: Would Daisy want that in real life? I asked her.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t a horror movie, but the plot of &#8220;Chaos Walking&#8221; could be your worst nightmare.</p>
<p>Tom Holland (as Todd Hewitt): &#8220;Whoa. Stop. Don&#8217;t come any closer. It&#8217;s a girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everyone can hear your thoughts!</p>
<p>Tom Holland (as Todd Hewitt): &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland star in new the sci-fi flick about Viola, a girl who crash-lands on a new planet with no women. And the men there, including Todd, have something called the Noise, which puts all their thoughts on full display!</p>
<p>Daisy Ridley: &#8220;She&#8217;s weirdly gone back in time to a place where you have to find your own food, you have to find your own way, and there is danger at every turn.&#8221;</p>
<p>But would Daisy want to hear all of rumored fiance Tom Bateman&#8217;s thoughts?</p>
<p>Daisy Ridley: &#8220;I&#8217;m quite a sensitive person, so I tend to pick up on things anyway. Which is already stressful, because it&#8217;s like, &#8216;Oh my God, live my life!&#8217; and I get bogged down by what other people might be feeling.&#8221;</p>
<p>And for all of us who are like that, it&#8217;s just&#8230;</p>
<p>Daisy Ridley: &#8220;&#8230;Ugh, exhausting! I&#8217;m so glad that we just relate to each on what we choose to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>The movie was grueling to shoot, and re-shoot, starting all the way back in 2017. But Tom says he had it under control.</p>
<p>Tom Holland: &#8220;I train really hard and I stay healthy and I make sure I take care of myself. And it helps me maintain these crazy characters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not that we didn&#8217;t already know.</p>
<p>Tom Holland: &#8220;The worst-case scenario is when you have a really physically emotional day, and you wake up and you&#8217;re just a waste of yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I did want to hear Daisy&#8217;s thoughts on social media.</p>
<p>Daisy Ridley: &#8220;Not for me. A lot of people do it great. Good for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; actress says she&#8217;s done with Instagram and Twitter. But is more open-minded to the internet&#8217;s cheesiest debate: Hawaiian pizza.</p>
<p>Daisy Ridley: &#8220;I mean I haven&#8217;t even had it — I&#8217;m not even exaggerating — since I was about 12 years old. I&#8217;m not against it. People put weird [expletive] On their food. You do you, boo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chaos Walking&#8221; releases in theaters next Friday, March 5.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Calling all fashionistas!</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a new museum exhibit in town that&#8217;s all about fashion.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s my kind of masterpiece. Designer Anna Sui is taking Deco inside her colorful world.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re probably used to seeing high fashion like this&#8230;</p>
<p>Or these days, even like this&#8230;</p>
<p>But this weekend, &#8220;The World of Anna Sui&#8221; will be on full display at the NSU Art Museum in Fort Lauderdale.</p>
<p>Bonnie Clearwater, curator: &#8220;A great way to really celebrate the world of fashion icon Anna Sui.&#8221;</p>
<p>The legendary designer is known for her fun, vintage-inspired styles. And she&#8217;s worked with everyone, from Naomi Campbell to Gigi and Bella Hadid.</p>
<p>This exhibition showcases some of her most famous collections from the past 30 years.</p>
<p>Anna Sui: &#8220;It just makes you cry. Like we didn&#8217;t realize we had such a huge body of work, and we&#8217;ve never really gone back and looked at our work because we&#8217;re always on to the next.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like the fashion industry itself, &#8220;The World of Anna Sui&#8221; features different trends and styles.</p>
<p>Think school girl, grunge, and even Americana looks.</p>
<p>Anna Sui: &#8220;Every collection really reflects what was going on during that time period.&#8221;</p>
<p>But you&#8217;ll see a lot more than just clothes at this exhibit.</p>
<p>Bonnie Clearwater, curator: &#8220;It really is about delving into Anna Sui&#8217;s creative process.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anna Sui: &#8220;We have several inspiration boards for different collections. This is usually how a designer builds a collection. There&#8217;s a story they&#8217;re trying to tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are even pieces worn by celebs, like this cowgirl ensemble rocked by Gigi Hadid, and Naomi Campbell&#8217;s backless chaps from the &#8217;90s.</p>
<p>Talk about a throwback!</p>
<p>Anna Sui: &#8220;Some people are happy to something that they have a memory of. Some people relate to the clothes, you know, remembering that period in their life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anna says the exhibit is super personal, and she really wants you to see it in person here in SoFlo.</p>
<p>Anna Sui: &#8220;Hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to come to Florida in the next few months. We&#8217;re trying to plan an event for maybe the closing part of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The World of Anna Sui&#8221; will be on display at the NSU Art Museum in Fort Lauderdale through October.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The famous science fiction novel &#8220;Dune&#8221; has a long history of never panning out on the big, or small, screen. Projects either never finished, or were poo-poo&#8217;d by critics and audiences, but could the new star-studded version finally break the curse? Witch doctor Alex Miranda is here with more.</p>
<p>Girls, this massive new movie reportedly cost $200 million to make, so no expense was spared &#8212; except maybe for the comfort of the stars, who really had to rough it out in the desert.</p>
<p>This all-star cast and these jaw-dropping visuals&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all out of this world in &#8220;Dune,&#8221; the latest film adaptation of the beloved science-fiction novel. Timothée Chalamet plays Paul Atreides, who moves to the only planet in the universe with &#8220;the spice,&#8221; a substance that extends human life and gives you superhuman abilities, but it&#8217;s no paradise.</p>
<p>Timothée Chalamet (as Paul Atreides): &#8220;I know you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The story is so complex, it&#8217;s being split into two movies, but Timothée says what it&#8217;s about is also sorta simple when you think about it.</p>
<p>Timothée Chalamet: &#8220;What all 15, 16, 17, 18 year olds go through, which is just that growing up is hard. There is a lesson and a metaphor in this movie for everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zendaya plays Chani, who&#8217;s giving Paul the side-eye at first.</p>
<p>Zendaya: &#8220;She&#8217;s tough, you know. She&#8217;s a warrior. She&#8217;s native to this planet. This is all she knows, so this other kid coming in, she&#8217;s not really feeling it.&#8221;</p>
<p>These A-list stars were really out in the hot and harsh Jordan desert. Like Javier Bardem, who said his special-made suit made it a tad more tolerable.</p>
<p>Javier Bardem: &#8220;Once you wore them, you were free to move, and there was kind of a cool, fresh breeze inside the suit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although, Oscar Issac, who plays Paul&#8217;s father, says&#8230;</p>
<p>Oscar Isaac: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t get that model of suit.&#8221;</p>
<p>And tough guy Jason Momoa added a little more detail.</p>
<p>Jason Momoa: &#8220;Mine would hold a bowl of me like soup.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jason is Duncan Idaho, AKA&#8230;</p>
<p>Jason Momoa: &#8220;Basically the greatest fighter in the [expletive] world.&#8221;</p>
<p>OK, go on, Jason.</p>
<p>Jason Momoa: &#8220;This film set the bar for how I want my career to go. I learned so much every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>But could any of these guys survive &#8220;Dune?&#8221;</p>
<p>Javier Bardem: &#8220;No way, not me.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&#8217;re going to have to wait for this one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dune&#8221; is slated for this October in theaters and HBO Max.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Masks are the newest must-have fashion accessory.</p>
<p>You also can&#8217;t leave home without &#8217;em.</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re like me and have trouble keeping track of your masks, we have a couple of convenient and fashionable options.</p>
<p>Lynn Martinez: &#8220;OK, I gotta go to makeup. where is my mask? Where is my dumb mask?! It would be so great if somebody invented something, like, I don&#8217;t know, it stays around your neck on a chain or something!&#8221;</p>
<p>Chapin VO: &#8220;It has been invented, Lynn!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lynn Martinez: &#8220;Uh, that&#8217;s great, but I need my mask now! [mask with chain drops in her hand] Wow! Look at that!!! Oh my goodness, perfect!&#8221;</p>
<p>Miami Mask Chains should make the U&#8217;s football team proud!</p>
<p>Ashley Finestone, designer: &#8220;Miami Mask Chains is a company that makes the most fashionable and functionable mask chains.&#8221;</p>
<p>We linked up with designer Ashley Finestone at 5 o&#8217;clock Somewhere Bar &amp; Grill in Hollywood to get a closer look.</p>
<p>No questions <em>masked</em>.</p>
<p>Ashley Finestone, designer: &#8220;They simply go around your neck, attach to any size face mask and can go with you wherever you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ashley says she created the mask chains to solve a problem.</p>
<p>Ashley Finestone, designer: &#8220;I would see all the ways in which people would wear their masks when they weren&#8217;t using it, hanging off of one ear, under their chin, putting it on dirty surfaces. I just knew there had to be a better, more convenient way.&#8221;</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s more than one way to wear them!</p>
<p>Ashley Finestone, designer: &#8220;Our designs are so unique and so beautiful that they even double as jewelry.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got nine different collections to choose from, and prices start at $25.</p>
<p>Want an option that&#8217;s totally strapless? <em>Mask</em> and you shall receive.</p>
<p>The Spa Mask is keeping things simple.</p>
<p>Rhonda Tescher, designer: &#8220;The straps are gone, no annoying ear loops, no anything behind the ears, it&#8217;s no strings attached. That&#8217;s what makes it so special.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rhonda Tescher showed us her creation at By The Strand salon in Weston, since this is the kind of place where a spa mask is perfect.</p>
<p>Rhonda Tescher, designer: &#8220;I came up with the idea sitting in a salon and I kept having to take my straps off, and I thought there has to be a better way. So, you peel off the tab, stick it on your face and go do your thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spa masks, which are actually KN95 masks, are only $3, and are meant to be used once.</p>
<p>Karina Pla, customer: &#8220;I absolutely love the spa mask. It&#8217;s super convenient, it&#8217;s comfortable, breathable. I highly recommend it.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Miami&#8217;s dessert scene just got a lot cooler. A popular ice cream shop has gone coast to coast.</p>
<p>Portland favorite Salt &amp; Straw officially opened its first east coast location Friday in Wynwood.</p>
<p>The ice cream joint has brought its famous flavors to the 305, but is also working with local vendors to offer some special Miami options.</p>
<p>Bonus trivia: the name Salt &amp; Straw is a tribute to how ice cream was made at the turn of the century.</p>
<p>Kim Malek, Salt &amp; Straw co-founder and CEO: &#8220;They would churn it in an ice cream churn with salt in the ice, then pack it on hay or straw to keep it cold because we didn&#8217;t have refrigeration back then! So salt and straw!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nancy Lopetegui, customer: &#8220;It&#8217;s getting hot again in Miami soon in Miami. It&#8217;s already hot right now! So it&#8217;s definitely awesome to get great ice cream here in Wynwood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another Salt &amp; Straw location is already on the way! They plan on opening a spot in Coconut Grove soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here at Deco, we&#8217;re always on the hunt for a new restaurant or spot to grab a drink. Thank you, &#8220;beery&#8221; much &#8212; and this time we&#8217;ve found a spot that&#8217;s all that and more. Deco&#8217;s checking out a place with tons of history that&#8217;s sure to hop to the top of your list.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry, be hoppy!</p>
<p>Cuba&#8217;s oldest brewery, Cervecería La Tropical, is now calling Miami home.</p>
<p>Manny Portuondo, Cervecería La Tropical: &#8220;I thought to myself, &#8216;How could something with over 135 years of heritage just vanish?&#8217; And I made it my passion project in life to bring it back to life and bring it back in a big way.&#8221;</p>
<p>This new hotspot is honoring its roots while also totally embracing its SoFlo vibes.</p>
<p>Manny Portuondo: &#8220;A brand with a Cuban soul but a Miami lifestyle &#8212; of sun, fun, and rhythm &#8212; and hopefully, we&#8217;re successful here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The place has it all. It&#8217;s a restaurant, brewery, tap room and garden &#8212; all in one.</p>
<p>Manny Portuondo: &#8220;When you come in to La Tropical, you&#8217;re first engulfed by Jardines La Tropical, which is a tropical, botanical garden in the middle of the city.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sure, the views are nice, but let&#8217;s talk about the brews, &#8217;cause this place makes their own beer, right on site.</p>
<p>Manny Portuondo: &#8220;Our flagship beer is La Tropical La Original, a Vienna style amber lager whose recipe dates back to 1888. And then for those craft aficionados, we brewed a tropical double IPA that has about 9.4% alcohol that we&#8217;re calling Gasolina.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can fill up with more than the beer. La Tropical is also cooking up something special to highlight its roots.</p>
<p>Cindy Hutson, chef, Cervecería La Tropical: &#8220;My menu is gonna be tapas, Caribbean, Cuban inspired. There&#8217;s lots of choices, for all kinds of dinners.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are Cuban staples like croquetas and <em>frita</em> burgers, but if you really wanna drink your beer and eat it, too, go with the steamed mussels.</p>
<p>Cindy Hutson: &#8220;Mussels with a beautiful artisan chorizo.&#8221;</p>
<p>Remember how we said beer? There&#8217;s plenty in the sauce, and that&#8217;s sure to make everyone a hoppy camper.</p>
<p>Diandra Lamas, diner: &#8220;A lot of times when you go to a brewery, you&#8217;re going to a brewery, and then you have to go to dinner, or you&#8217;re going to dinner and then you&#8217;re gonna go to a brewery, but here you can get amazing food and awesome beer as well.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thirty-three years ago, Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall royally killed the comedy game with &#8220;Coming to America,&#8221; but now they&#8217;re coming back to the U.S. in a celebrity-filled sequel that even stars Queen Elizabeth. (Just kidding, it doesn&#8217;t.) Deco&#8217;s Alex Miranda, the man who famously puts the toothpaste on Prince Charles&#8217; toothbrush, has the story.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming 2 America&#8221; is worth the long wait, but just one minute into my conversation with Eddie and Arsenio, things got royally X-rated, and I swear I did not start it this time.</p>
<p>Thirty-three years later&#8230;</p>
<p>James Earl Jones (as King Jaffe Joffer): &#8220;Now, you will be king.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sequel we all didn&#8217;t know we needed in 2021&#8230;</p>
<p>James Earl Jones (as King Jaffe Joffer): &#8220;You have a son.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is finally here!</p>
<p>Eddie Murphy (as Akeem): &#8220;We are going back to America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arsenio Hall (as Semmi): &#8220;Oh, hell no, Your Majesty!&#8221;</p>
<p>In &#8220;Coming 2 America,&#8221; as in the number 2, Prince Akeem is back in Queens, New York, now as the King of Zumunda, to search for his &#8212; surprise! &#8212; long-lost son.</p>
<p>Jermaine Fowler (as Lavelle): &#8220;I don&#8217;t need no handout. Wait a minute. I&#8217;m going to pack!&#8221;</p>
<p>Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall want us all to celebrate like Royals.</p>
<p>Arsenio Hall: &#8220;Hey, Alex! Come on, you gotta put on the crown! Yeah! Put on the crown, Alex!&#8221;</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;You know I will!&#8221;</p>
<p>But the pressure, after three decades?!</p>
<p>The guys told me, meh.</p>
<p>Eddie Murphy: &#8220;When I get the idea, and we got the writers, and we got it on paper, and we got a script, I was like, &#8216;Let&#8217;s go do it.&#8217; I never felt pressure. I felt like we were going to do a good movie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, until now.</p>
<p>Arsenio Hall: &#8220;I never felt pressure until you asked that question. Now, I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Should we be nervous? Should we feel the pressure?&#8217; Now I feel the pressure!&#8221;</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m feeling some type of way after these next answers.</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;What would be the most lavish luxury that you would treat yourself to?&#8221;</p>
<p>Asenio Hall: &#8220;Bathers. I like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wait, what?</p>
<p>Eddie Murphy: &#8220;I would want a person just washing my [expletive].&#8221;</p>
<p>What???</p>
<p>Eddie Murphy: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I would feel regal while that was happening.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moving on. But, right now, we do need a feel-good comedy more than ever, amiright?</p>
<p>Eddie Murphy: &#8220;It&#8217;s a fairy tale. It&#8217;s just pure entertainment, escapism. You go to the movie and just have a good time. There&#8217;s no message, there&#8217;s no heaviness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just laughs &#8230; and some miscommunication.</p>
<p>Tracy Morgan (as Uncle Reem): &#8220;&#8221;Let me hear you say, &#8216;Hey ho.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Eddie Murphy (as Akeem): &#8220;Hey, ho!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tracy Morgan (as Uncle Reem): &#8220;No, not to his mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arsenio Hall: &#8220;You&#8217;ve given me comedy life, bruh. I appreciate that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;Thank you, thank you so much.&#8221; (bows)</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming 2 America&#8221; starts streaming on Amazon Prime on Friday, March 5.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are officially out as Royals, but the family drama is still so gossipy. Queen Elizabeth has announced a new TV special, and it&#8217;s set to air right before Harry and Meghan&#8217;s Oprah interview. On the same day. If that is not a royal power move, I don&#8217;t know a Corgi from a Dorgi.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a battle royale, and the world seems to be watching.</p>
<p>Narrator: &#8220;Her Majesty the Queen, monarch, head of state of the United Kingdom and Great Britain and Northern Ireland.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the royal family versus Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.</p>
<p>As of last week, the couple announced a new pregnancy and their official break from life as senior Royals.</p>
<p>Alastair Bruce, royal historian: &#8220;The Queen took the view that it was not going to be possible to deliver what the Duke and Duchess of Sussex wanted.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the decision was announced, Meghan and Harry were stripped of their royal patronages. A blow to the couple.</p>
<p>Alastair Bruce: &#8220;The Queen has to stick by the absolutely clear nature of serving the public, and that is not to personal advantage for herself or for any member of her family.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon after, Meghan and Harry announced a sit-down interview with Oprah Winfrey airing March 7.</p>
<p>The Queen, meanwhile, announced Monday her own TV special airing March 7, celebrating Commonwealth Day. It&#8217;ll run on the BBC right before the Duke and Duchess&#8217; interview on CBS.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Day special will feature all senior Royals. The 94-year old monarch will appear, too, in a pre-recorded message from Windsor Castle.</p>
<p>For Meghan and Harry, though, it is business as usual. The duo made a surprise appearance on a Spotify stream promoting their new podcast.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Miami baker is having her cake and eating it, too, and her cakes are daring and delicious. Deco caught up with Chiantae Campbell and dished on her Food Network debut.</p>
<p>Chiantae Campbell: &#8220;I do custom cakes, wedding cakes, custom desserts and all types of fun treats.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now here&#8217;s a real treat. Chiantae Campbell of Chic Little Cakes in Aventura is getting her bake on for the Food Network show &#8220;Spring Baking Championship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ali Khan, Food Network host: &#8220;In each episode, the bakers compete with two challenges, and at the end of each episode, a baker is eliminated until we get to the finale, where three bakers go into superbake mode.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chiantae Campbell: &#8220;I was incredibly excited to be on the show. Actually, when I got the call, I was at the cake supply store, and I literally screamed in the store.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&#8217;d scream, too, if you had a chance to win $25,000, but for Chiantae, it wasn&#8217;t just about the money.</p>
<p>Chiantae Campbell: &#8220;My time on the show was just filled with pure enjoyment, making desserts and different types of pastries and cakes. It was just a wonderful experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looks like the feeling was mutual. Host Ali Kahn couldn&#8217;t stop raving about her.</p>
<p>Ali Khan: &#8220;I was just shocked, when you realize how young she is, and how much talent she has. She&#8217;s pretty amazing.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can see &#8220;Spring Baking Championship&#8221; on the Food Network, Mondays at 9 p.m.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The streets of South Florida are paved with gold because there&#8217;s a treasure waiting for South Florida&#8217;s greatest scavenger hunter. For more, let&#8217;s go to Alex Miranda. A man who doesn&#8217;t need a treasure map to know where the pleasure is. Is that true, Alex?</p>
<p>X marks the spot! Now, next Saturday, we&#8217;ve all got a shot at $10,000!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all across Miami, but if you&#8217;re really smart and bring the brainiac in your pod, you would take Lynn, Shireen and me out to lunch, right?</p>
<p>A treasure hunt awaits, all across Miami, next Saturday!</p>
<p>Ian Lovejoy, Treasure Quest Adventures: &#8220;We wanted to come up with something that families could do, something that was COVID-conscious, something that could get people outdoors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Treasure Quest Adventures is using virtual and physical clues to help you find&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;$10,000 in cash.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schmoneyyy, as Cardi B would say.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works! On the 27th at 11 a.m, you&#8217;ll get a link texted to you. Then, you solve a series of clues, puzzles and riddles, which will get harder as you go! Oh, and you&#8217;ll need a car.</p>
<p>Ian Lovejoy: &#8220;You&#8217;re going to want to have a fully-charged smart device and a pad and a pencil and a gassed up car, because you&#8217;re going to be driving around.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everybody can play.</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;A clue!&#8221;</p>
<p>But only one can win the $10,000!</p>
<p>Ian Lovejoy: &#8220;It starts out relatively simple with simple clues, quiz questions and trivia questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;I am made of eight letters, can hold one inside. Pay a small amount, send me for a ride. What am I?&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, envelope!</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;Envelope, six, seven, eight, yeah! This is so embarrassing!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ian Lovejoy: &#8220;The back half is for the true competitors, who are really going to make it to the $10,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, I know how this goes&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;So now that I got the answer to the easy question&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I phoned a friend for the rest of the scavenger hunt.</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;Let&#8217;s find the $10,000!&#8221;</p>
<p>But, that was a bust.</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;You&#8217;re no help!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tickets are $55, and part of the proceeds go to Feeding South Florida, so a win-win, whether you win or not.</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;You know what? I&#8217;ve looked all over the place. I can&#8217;t find the $10,000 anywhere. Good luck to all of you guys, but at this point, I&#8217;m out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Get ready! It&#8217;s next Saturday, and they have three more $1,000 hunts each Saturday after that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love me some Cotton Candy, and so does &#8220;The Masked Dancer.&#8221; That&#8217;s who won the very first season of show, and it&#8217;s someone who&#8217;s very used to winning trophies.</p>
<p>Gabby Douglas is &#8220;The Masked Dancer&#8221; champ. Now the three-time Olympic gold medalist has to find a place for her newest bling.</p>
<p>Gabby Douglas (during show): &#8220;I&#8217;m probably going to put it where all my other trophies are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gabby Douglas: &#8220;I had a blast. Every single soul was so nice, super helpful, and honestly, this definitely compares to the Olympics, because it was such an exciting journey. Just to be able to do something so outside of myself, so out of the normal, and to go and do it, it&#8217;s just a very different experience. I was so grateful that I had this opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Competing is nothing new to Gabby, but dancing was a whole new world, and she loved it.</p>
<p>Gabby Douglas: &#8220;Every single dance style, I&#8217;ve never done anything like this before, and I can&#8217;t even pick a favorite, I can&#8217;t even choose. The aerial work, the scooter, the jive, the lifts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gabby&#8217;s loving the reactions she&#8217;s getting.</p>
<p>Gabby Douglas: &#8220;Just the amount of love and support and positivity that&#8217;s being poured into C.C., and we really wanted Cotton Candy just to be just a big fluff of light, airy goodness, because there&#8217;s so much craziness and just so much going on in the world today.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she can use what she learned on this journey going forward.</p>
<p>Gabby Douglas: &#8220;One hundred percent. I have learned to do something new, and honestly, just to challenge myself and to go outside myself and try it, and I&#8217;m definitely taking these dances with me, because they are a great workout, by the way, and they are so fun to do. But they have really sparked my passion in the dance world.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After 80 years, Tom and Jerry still can&#8217;t get their hands off each other&#8217;s throats &#8212; kind of like Lynn and Shireen on a bad day. The famous duo is coming back to the big screen with more PG-approved violence than ever. Deco&#8217;s Alex Miranda, who doesn&#8217;t have a violent bone in his body, is here with the deets.</p>
<p>Chloë Grace Moretz and Colin Jost star in the newest &#8220;Tom and Jerry&#8221; saga, but how much are they like their characters? Well, it turns out, a lot.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t we all just get along? After 80 years of Tom and Jerry, clearly not!</p>
<p>In the new movie, starring Chloë Grace Moretz, the iconic enemies battle it out again &#8212; this time at New York&#8217;s finest hotel.</p>
<p>Chloë Grace Moretz (as Kayla): &#8220;I shine under pressure, like a diamond, or Rihanna.&#8221;</p>
<p>After Kayla lies her way into a high-profile job at the Royal Gate, she hires Tom to get rid of Jerry, before he ruins a wedding for two of Hollywood&#8217;s hottest stars.</p>
<p>Chloë Grace Moretz: &#8220;Little does she know, they go way back, and she&#8217;s tay in over her head on so many levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>But has Chloë ever lied in an interview? Oh, yeah!</p>
<p>Chloë Grace Moretz: &#8220;I definitely did a pretty big lie to Martin Scorsese when I auditioned for &#8220;Hugo Cabret,&#8221; and I told him that I was English.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chloë Grace Moretz (as Isabelle): &#8220;Oh, good! I love secrets!&#8221;</p>
<p>Chloë Grace Moretz: &#8220;I had this whole story, because he was only seeing British girls, and I booked the part.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Saturday Night Live&#8221; star Colin Jost plays Ben, the groom.</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;Team Tom or Team Jerry?&#8221;</p>
<p>Colin Jost: &#8220;If I&#8217;m honest with myself, I&#8217;m more of a Tom, and just frustrated and angry and bumbling.&#8221;</p>
<p>It turns out Colin&#8217;s wife, <em>the</em> Scarlett Johansson, might see a little Ben in Colin.</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;When Ben does something, Ben does it big. Would you say that Scarlett would say the same about you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Colin Jost: &#8220;You know, I think so. I think, in some ways, there&#8217;s definitely been times where I&#8217;ve gotten us in trouble, or things have backfired because I didn&#8217;t think them through, and that&#8217;s a great theme from the &#8216;Tom and Jerry&#8217; film.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;Life lessons, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Chloë offered up some life advice, too, real advice, for young girls looking to make it on social media.</p>
<p>Michael Peña (as Terence): &#8220;If a picture of this mouse is tweeted out to Insta-book-face or Tikkity Tok, we will be ruined.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chloë: &#8220;Give all that energy you want to give, but hold some things dear to your heart and don&#8217;t share everything, is what I would say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Catch &#8220;Tom and Jerry&#8221; in theaters and on HBO Max next Friday, Jan. 26.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New York favorite has migrated south to Miami! Not your uncle Harold or your in-laws. Although, they&#8217;ll probably retire here at some point. A Korean steakhouse has brought its tastes to the 305 with a brand new location. Lucky us!</p>
<p>Cote Korean Steakhouse in the Design District is more than meats the eye.</p>
<p>Simon Kim, owner: &#8220;It marries the fun and fire of a Korean barbecue restaurant with American classic steakhouse, where beef is king.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cote definitely gives beef the royal treatment.</p>
<p>Check out the dry aging room.</p>
<p>Simon Kim: &#8220;We only serve the highest grade, which is A5 Wagyu.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the meat is cooked right at your table!</p>
<p>The restaurant is also making a Korean staple in-house: Kimchi, which is like pickled vegetables.</p>
<p>David Shim, executive chef: &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna welcome you to our fermentation lab. Not a lot of people get to enter this room.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re honored to be here.</p>
<p>David Shim: &#8220;This is where all the magic happens. Magic in the sense that we transform our seasonal, local vegetables that we have on our menu to a different form.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all great, but you&#8217;re probably gonna wanna wash your meal down with some wine. Cote has you covered.</p>
<p>Victoria James, beverage director: &#8220;We have bottles going back 150 years. For example, we have an 1870 Madeira here, so a little bit of age! We also have another incredibly rare wine called Essencia. This is actually served by the spoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wanna be spoon-fed wine!</p>
<p>Victoria James: &#8220;And that&#8217;s just a few bottles from our 1,200 collection.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cote already seems to be making a good first impression.</p>
<p>Christopher Madden, customer: &#8220;There&#8217;s not too many places where you can get good service and good food. I&#8217;m grateful Miami, the Design District, has a place to come and eat some great food.&#8221;</p>
<p>The restaurant&#8217;s success really just boils down to basic math.</p>
<p>Simon Kim: &#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty simple formula. I can actually explain this in emojis. Meat plus fire plus booze equals smile. It&#8217;s a simple mantra.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>FOR MORE INFO: </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Demi Lovato’s drug overdose in 2018 resulted in the singer having three strokes and a heart attack, leaving her with physical limitations that still affect her.</p>
<p>Lovato reveals publicly for the first time details about the near-fatal incident in “Demi Lovato: Dancing With the Devil,” a four-part docuseries debuting March 23 on YouTube Originals.</p>
<p>In the trailer, Lovato says doctors told her family she had five to 10 minutes to live.</p>
<p>“I was left with brain damage, and I still deal with the effects of that today,” she said in a video call on Wednesday. “I don’t drive a car because I have blind spots in my vision. For a long time, I had a really hard time reading. It was a big deal when I was able to read a book, which was like two months later, because my vision was so blurry.”</p>
<p>Lovato said the lasting repercussions “are still there to remind me of what could happen if I ever get into a dark place again.”</p>
<p>The 28-year-old singer, who sported pink hair on the call, has been working since age 10, when she appeared on the TV series “Barney &amp; Friends.” She went to rehab for the first time at 18, after struggling with bipolar disorder, anorexia and bullying.</p>
<p>Lovato has shared her private struggles before, in a 2012 MTV documentary and in a 2017 YouTube doc in which she said she was still dealing with alcohol and cocaine addictions after undergoing further rehab. She said speaking publicly on those programs provided her with the accountability that kept her sober for six years until her relapse in 2018.</p>
<p>“My purpose in putting this out is to help people who have been on the same path as I have,” she said. “I wanted to set the record straight, and I wanted to reveal it all for my fans.”</p>
<p>Lovato’s family, as well as Elton John and Christina Aguilera, are among those interviewed in the doc that was shot over a year. In the third segment, Lovato discusses past traumas in her life.</p>
<p>Lovato doesn&#8217;t relate to artists who claim they are most creative when they are in a dark place or using drugs.</p>
<p>“I feel like the best work that I make is when I&#8217;m present and when I am aware of what&#8217;s going on in my life,” she said. “That&#8217;s when the truth just flows out of me. As long as I continue to tell my truth, I&#8217;m going to make music that resonates with people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lovato re-launched her singing career at last year&#8217;s Grammy Awards and sang the national anthem at the 2020 Super Bowl before the coronavirus pandemic took hold.</p>
<p>Last month, Lovato sang on a TV special marking President Joe Biden&#8217;s inauguration.</p>
<p>Despite her near-death experience, Lovato wouldn&#8217;t change what happened to her.</p>
<p>“Everything had to happen in order for me to learn the lessons that I learned,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I look back and sometimes I get sad when I think of the pain that I had to endure to overcome what I have. I&#8217;m so proud of the person that I am today. One of the main reasons I’m coming forward is so I never have to live that life again.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A woman so bad, she&#8217;s good, and a squirrel with superpowers. No, you&#8217;re not hallucinating. Deco&#8217;s checking out what&#8217;s hot in theaters and streaming, in this week&#8217;s Showtime.</p>
<p>Macon Blair (as Feldstrom): &#8220;She forces them into the home, auctions off their house and uses the proceeds to pay herself!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosamund Pike (as Marla Grayson): &#8220;Because caring is my job.&#8221;</p>
<p>We love ourselves some capitalism, don&#8217;t we, folks?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to be bad in the Netflix dark comedy, &#8220;I Care a Lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosamund Pike stars as a legal guardian who takes advantage of the elderly, but when she messes with the wrong client, things get cray-cray.</p>
<p>Rosamund told Deco it was important she made her character fun, even if she&#8217;s corrupt.</p>
<p>Rosamund Pike: &#8220;There&#8217;s gotta be something so ruthless and so dismayingly kind of awful about this woman that you&#8217;re just riveted by her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frances McDormand (as Fern): &#8220;My dad used to say, what&#8217;s remembered lives. I maybe spent too much of my life just remembering.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Frances McDormand loses everything thanks to the recession, she hops into her van and heads west to find herself in &#8220;Nomadland.&#8221; Now that&#8217;s a trip.</p>
<p>Nick Robinson (as Ross Ulbricht): &#8220;I&#8217;ve always wanted to change the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alexandra Shipp (as Julia): &#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nick Robinson (as Ross Ulbricht): &#8220;Amazon for drugs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Silk Road&#8221; is full of sex, drugs, but no rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll. The movie tells the story of a drug dealer who creates a dark net website, and the DEA agent who goes undercover to bust him.</p>
<p>Dame Judi Dench (as Madame Cecily Arcati)): &#8220;The moon is full, and we must harness its power.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan Stevens (as Charles Condomine): &#8220;Perfect.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She&#8217;s ruthless, ingenious and conniving to her core. Not just you, Shireen.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re referring to Rosamund Pike in &#8220;I Care A Lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>She&#8217;s a total lioness in the new Netflix dark comedy.</p>
<p>Yay, morally bankrupt girl power!!!</p>
<p>Deco dished with Rosamund about the movie she cares a lot about.</p>
<p>Rosamund Pike (as Marla Grayson): &#8220;You have to come with me. And remember, I&#8217;m here to help.&#8221;</p>
<p>Do NOT let Marla Grayson care for your loved ones.</p>
<p>Chris Messina (as Dean Ericson): &#8220;Look at all these cash cows on your wall just leaking money into your account!&#8221;</p>
<p>In &#8220;I Care A Lot&#8221;, Rosamund Pike is Marla, a sly legal guardian who takes advantage of the elderly. And even though she&#8217;s doing shady things, she&#8217;s actually devilishly delightful to watch.</p>
<p>Rosamund Pike: &#8220;I thought about that a lot. I thought, &#8216;How far can I push this and still make her fun to watch?&#8217; That was very important to me. Her hustle&#8217;s good. It&#8217;s smart. She&#8217;s not actually breaking the law. The system is set up for her to win. You&#8217;re kind of marveling at the ingenuity of her plan even while you&#8217;re appalled by it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marla&#8217;s technically not the bad guy here, the system kinda is.</p>
<p>Rosamund&#8217;s co-star, Eiza Gonzalez, really hammered home that point to Deco.</p>
<p>Eiza Gonzalez: &#8220;I think this movie underlines the complexities of the American Dream. What wouldn&#8217;t we be willing to do for whatever we want?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosamund Pike: &#8220;If you didn&#8217;t root for Marla, who else would you root for?&#8221;</p>
<p>Fair enough. Marla&#8217;s business is booming — until she messes with the wrong victim.</p>
<p>Folks, try to avoid upsetting a violent gangster.</p>
<p>Peter Dinklage (as Roman Lunyov): &#8220;I don&#8217;t like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosamund Pike (as Marla Grayson): &#8220;You only just met me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s played by Peter Dinklage, and he makes life very painful for Marla.</p>
<p>Their epic battle leads us to an instant classic on-camera scream from Rosamund.</p>
<p>Rosamund Pike (as Marla Grayson): &#8220;Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Huhhhhhh!&#8221;</p>
<p>No wonder she&#8217;s nominated for a Golden Globe!</p>
<p>Rosamund Pike: &#8220;It&#8217;s the combination of &#8216;[expletive] ya, I&#8217;m still here!&#8217; and also &#8216;[expletive] you that you did this to me!'&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosamund Pike (as Marla Grayson): &#8220;I&#8217;m never letting you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dianne Wiest (as Jennifer Peterson): &#8220;Oooooooooh, you&#8217;re in trouble now!&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shireen loves hanging at a place you can lounge around for hours, you know, until the owners come home, but for a more legal night out, let&#8217;s go to Deco&#8217;s nightlight editor and private dancer, Alex Miranda.</p>
<p>Girls, celebrity chef Paul Niedermann won &#8220;Hell&#8217;s Kitchen&#8221; Season 9, but he&#8217;s also winning over the hearts, and mouths, on Las Olas with his new, dynamic restaurant, Salt 7.</p>
<p>Just like Ariana Grande&#8230;</p>
<p>Ariana Grande (singing): &#8220;Switching up positions for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new waterfront Fort Lauderdale restaurant Salt 7&#8230;</p>
<p>Paul Niedermann: &#8220;We can&#8217;t wait to show everyone what we can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is switching it up from day to night!</p>
<p>Heloisa Britto, customer: &#8220;The atmosphere is great. I&#8217;ve been sitting at the bar. We&#8217;ve been here for hours. We could just sit here all day and watch the boats go by.&#8221;</p>
<p>But after the sun goes down, it&#8217;s a full-on nightclub! And the Las Olas hot spot&#8230;</p>
<p>Paul Niedermann: &#8220;Salt 7 is a modern American eatery where we focus on high-end steaks and seafood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Was cooked up by none other than &#8220;Hell&#8217;s Kitchen&#8221; winner and Cooper City native, Chef Paul.</p>
<p>Paul Niedermann: &#8220;Well, winning &#8216;Hell&#8217;s Kitchen&#8217; was probably one of the pinnacle moments of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, and in case you were wondering&#8230;</p>
<p>Paul Niedermann: &#8220;Chef Ramsey is actually one of the nicest men I&#8217;ve ever met in my entire life. He&#8217;s the most genuine person I&#8217;ve ever met.&#8221;</p>
<p>The plates here could be the pinnacle of your week, too! Like, this Floridian style crab cake.</p>
<p>Paul Niedermann: &#8220;Which is my interpretation of a Maryland-style crab cake, but instead, of using much more of a mustard base, I use more of a mayonnaise base.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or how about this signature roasted salmon?</p>
<p>Paul Niedermann: &#8220;And then, we finish it with romesco sauce, which is a bell pepper and almond sauce.&#8221;</p>
<p>Heloisa is definitely coming back.</p>
<p>Heloisa Britto: &#8220;It was amazing, and we had ceviche for appetizer, and it was really nice and refreshing.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s no accident, either.</p>
<p>Paul Niedermann: &#8220;I like to make my fair a little bit lighter due to the fact that we are always in the heat, and I like to add a little bit of citrus notes to things that may necessarily not have them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even Ariana says&#8230;</p>
<p>Ariana Grande (singing): &#8220;Perfect, perfect, too good to be true.&#8221;</p>
<p>Heloisa Britto: &#8220;I love it here daytime or nighttime. I love the vibe. It&#8217;s just very warm and welcoming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Salt 7 also has their long-running location in Delray Beach on Second Avenue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It feels like it&#8217;s been 84 years since we&#8217;ve all been to a real-life concert, but one hotel in Fort Lauderdale says they know how to fix that. It involves a social distancing-safe, private show. Our own Alex Miranda has the story.</p>
<p>Need a break from it all?</p>
<p>Anna Macdiarmid, W Fort Lauderdale: &#8220;This is amazing. You&#8217;re facing the Atlantic Ocean. You have everything below us here. We have our pool deck.&#8221;</p>
<p>OK, I&#8217;m in! But what if I told you the W Fort Lauderdale could get even better?</p>
<p>Now, when you book an oceanfront suite, you can also hear some Suite Sounds in a private balcony concert.</p>
<p>Anna Macdiarmid: &#8220;Everybody&#8217;s at home. They can&#8217;t go to a concert. We decided to bring the concert to the hotel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just choose from an acoustic guitar duo, a keyboardist, violinist, saxophonist or DJ.</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;I thought that the DJs were just posing when they stand here, but you&#8217;re saying they really do something?&#8221;</p>
<p>DJ Amaris: &#8220;They really do mix!&#8221;</p>
<p>OK, I knew they were doing something! And with this new amenity&#8230;</p>
<p>DJ Amaris: &#8220;Press play.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;Aye!&#8221;</p>
<p>DJ Amaris told me all you gotta do is move to the beat.</p>
<p>DJ Amaris: &#8220;Either you have a head nod, your foot tapping, or you have your own little dance.&#8221;</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to tell me twice.</p>
<p>Sorry for the confusion. These concerts are for you to sit back and enjoy.</p>
<p>Anna Macdiarmid: &#8220;From an anniversary to a family function to birthdays to anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s $350 for 30 minutes and $700 for an hour. Just make sure to get your money&#8217;s worth.</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;It&#8217;s the perfect addition to your day!&#8221;</p>
<p>But, maybe not too much.</p>
<p>OK, time to call it a night.</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;Lena, I&#8217;m trying to sleep!&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s best to call the hotel to make your reservation since the rooms have to be oceanfront in order to add the Suite Sounds option.</p>
<p>Plus, you can tell them which kind of musician you want.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;The Masked Dancer&#8221; is heating up its moves.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the Zebra was sent back to the wild.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, get ready to rumble with this punchy review.</p>
<p>If &#8220;The Masked Dancer&#8221; hasn&#8217;t shimmied its way into your heart yet, or would that be hips, what are you waiting for?</p>
<p>The costume/dance extravaganza is pulling out all the stops as the top contestants twist, strut, whip &amp; flip their stuff to win &#8220;The Diamond Mask.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fossi, Fossi, Fossi&#8230; Martha Graham, Madonna, Paula Abdul, Abdul! I digress.</p>
<p>Last week, the final four put on a great show! But it was the Zebra whose stripes were put to the test.</p>
<p>There was no hoofin&#8217; around it, the Zebra was unmasked [to reveal]&#8230; 11-time world boxing champ, Oscar De La Hoya.</p>
<p>Oscar De La Hoya: &#8220;I swear, I have two left feet. When I put on the mask for the first time, my smile was like from ear to ear. I couldn&#8217;t stop laughing because I was having so much fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oscar says, competing on &#8220;The Masked Dancer&#8221; has motivated him to get back in the ring.<br />
And he&#8217;s no spring chicken, I mean, spring zebra.</p>
<p>Oscar De La Hoya: &#8220;I&#8217;m actually thinking of maybe lacing up the gloves. I&#8217;ve officially been inspired, especially from Mike Tyson, who laced up the gloves a few weeks ago. He looked great. He said he felt great.&#8221;</p>
<p>Until then, Oscar&#8217;s just enjoying the new pep in his step.</p>
<p>Oscar De La Hoya: &#8220;Just the fact that I was able to train my body to go through this process of dancing. I went back to the gym. I started doing yoga. I feel so good, so why not? Why not go back to my element and do it one more time?&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t miss Tulip, Sloth and Cotton Candy as they go toe-to-toe Wednesday on &#8220;The Masked Dancer&#8221; at 8 p.m., right after Deco.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billie Holiday is a jazz legend, but her life was far from a happy tune. This lady did sing the blues, and she lived them, too. Now all that drama is hitting Hulu in &#8220;The United States vs. Billie Holiday.&#8221; Something tells us it&#8217;s going to be this cast versus all other award show nominees.</p>
<p>Character in &#8220;The United States vs. Billie Holiday&#8221;: &#8220;NAACP says Billie Holiday is the voice of our people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just listen to it.</p>
<p>Andra Day (as Billie Holiday): (singing) &#8220;I love me&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>But in &#8220;The United States vs. Billie Holiday,&#8221; it&#8217;s not so sweet.</p>
<p>In the biopic, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics launches a sting operation against the jazz singer &#8212; and doesn&#8217;t let up until her death.</p>
<p>Garrett Hedlund (as Harry Anslinger): &#8220;Those lyrics provoke people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeff Corbett (as Congressman J.P. Thomas): &#8220;Y&#8217;all got a plan?&#8221;</p>
<p>Damian Joseph Quinn (as Roy Cohn): &#8220;She&#8217;s a drug addict.&#8221;</p>
<p>Garrett Hedlund (as Harry Anslinger): &#8220;Exactly!&#8221;</p>
<p>Grammy nominee Andra Day plays Billie. She says, in a way, the icon gave up her life to speak up about racial inequality.</p>
<p>Andra Day: &#8220;She is truly the godmother of civil rights, who did not die because she was a tragic drug addict, but her life was really siphoned from her intentionally. This was a very slow, public lynching.&#8221;</p>
<p>The FBN reportedly started to threaten Billie after she performed this song.</p>
<p>Andra Day (as Billie Holiday): (singing) &#8220;Southern trees&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Strange Fruit,&#8221; about lynchings and murders.</p>
<p>Dusan Dukic (as Joe Glaser): &#8220;Get her off that stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andra Day (as Billie Holiday): (singing): &#8220;They&#8217;re strange&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Daniels directed the drama, which is already nominated for Best Actress and Original Song Golden Globes. He says her legacy is inspiring him today.</p>
<p>Lee Daniels: &#8220;The gift that she&#8217;s given me is teaching me not to judge. It lives in all of her music. It lives in her pores, lives in every action that she did..&#8221;</p>
<p>It also touches on a lesser-known story: that she ended up in an affair with Jimmy Fletcher, the agent hired to nab her on drug charges.</p>
<p>Lee Daniels: &#8220;Empathize with Jimmy, that was the hardest thing. We understood that he had a job to do, but that he was regretful of what he did. And how do you make up for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>But more than anything, Andra wants us to recognize Billie Holiday&#8217;s real impact.</p>
<p>Andra Day: &#8220;We need to thank Billie Holiday and acknowledge her story in order to move forward and understand our present and our future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The United States vs. Billie Holiday&#8221; will be available to stream on Hulu starting Feb. 26.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kevin James has the need &#8230; the need for speed! He&#8217;s starring in a new sitcom called &#8220;The Crew.&#8221; It&#8217;s set in the world of NASCAR. Deco went for a joyride with the comedian.</p>
<p>Buckle up!</p>
<p>Bruce McGill (as Bobby Spencer): &#8220;Meet your new boss!&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin James (as Kevin Gibson): &#8220;You&#8217;ve gotta be kidding me! I&#8217;ve got underwear older than her!&#8221;</p>
<p>A middle-of-the-road NASCAR team has to suddenly shift gears when the owner&#8217;s daughter unexpectedly takes over the whole operation.</p>
<p>Kevin James (as Kevin Gibson): &#8220;Think of this as war! Our best odds are to stick together!&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin James stars as the crew chief in the new Netflix sitcom, &#8220;The Crew.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kev tells Deco you do not have to be a racing fan to watch the show.</p>
<p>Kevin James: &#8220;It&#8217;s a workplace comedy when it comes down to it. It&#8217;s driven by storylines and characters, and you&#8217;re gonna hopefully fall in love with them and really wanna see what happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got plenty of office shenanigans and good old employee rivalries.</p>
<p>Gary Anthony Williams (as Chuck): &#8220;Jake just hits the gas and tries to finish first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Paris Berelc (as Jessie De La Cruz): &#8220;I&#8217;m guessing that&#8217;s also how he is with his ladies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin James: &#8220;That&#8217;s the backdrop. NASCAR, and it&#8217;s that world, but as you dive into it, you realize it&#8217;s the same relationships everywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin never happened to be much of a NASCAR fan himself. But then&#8230;</p>
<p>Kevin James: &#8220;I did a couple of those &#8216;Gentlemen, start your engines!&#8217; with Sandler.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin James and Adam Sandler: &#8220;ENNNNNNNNNNNNGIIIIIIIIIIINESSSS!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin James: &#8220;Going to an event, which is completely different from seeing it on TV and what you think NASCAR is about, it&#8217;s a whole different world, and it blew my mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>While his character isn&#8217;t taking us for a spin in the show, we wondered if we could trust Kevin behind the wheel in real life.</p>
<p>Kevin James: &#8220;I&#8217;m aggressive. I&#8217;m a very aggressive driver, growing up in New York, but I think I&#8217;m good! Yeah! I think I&#8217;m pretty good, yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>Huh, it almost sounds like he&#8217;s trying to convince himself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just like on FOX&#8217;s &#8220;9-1-1,&#8221; a lot of families have secrets. Sometimes, it&#8217;s Uncle Manuel&#8217;s picadillo recipe. Other times, it&#8217;s that you have a secret brother.</p>
<p>Aisha Hinds (as Henrietta): &#8220;It&#8217;s a miracle you even survived childhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, brother! &#8220;9-1-1&#8217;s&#8221; Buck is learning a family secret.</p>
<p>Oliver Stark (as Buck): &#8220;I had a brother.&#8221;</p>
<p>This season, viewers are watching Buck getting stuck in his own head.</p>
<p>Oliver Stark: &#8220;This character, who started very much this macho, cocky, you know, almost bordering on unlikable at times, can then grow out of that, and work on himself and throw himself into therapy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oliver Stark says we&#8217;re going to learn the gritty truth about his character.</p>
<p>Oliver Stark: &#8220;There&#8217;s been this secret, and he has been lied to his whole life, that he had another sibling who died. I think it&#8217;s just going to take a little while, and some trauma and some processing, to be able to reestablish his connections with the people around him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oliver Stark (as Buck): &#8220;I crashed my bike.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Oliver loved playing a younger Buck in &#8220;9-1-1&#8221; flashbacks.</p>
<p>Oliver Stark: &#8220;He was a bartender in Peru, and the kind of planning stages of that, as soon as I read it, I was on the phone, I was like, &#8216;I want to look ridiculous. I want it to have been a real phase in his life.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Oliver&#8217;s take is this: when Buck is saving people, he&#8217;s also saving himself. Very heady stuff.</p>
<p>Oliver Stark: &#8220;The thing that I was really eager to feel like, in the current, in the modern-day emergency, was that if he doesn&#8217;t save these people, he doesn&#8217;t save himself, and how much his identity is tied to being a firefighter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Catch new episodes of &#8220;9-1-1,&#8221; Mondays at 8 p.m., followed by &#8220;9-1-1: Lone Star&#8221; at 9 p.m., right here on 7.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shireen knows a thing or two about falling in love on a farm. (Actually, it&#8217;s a ranch.) Two Hollywood it-girls are roughing it out in rural New York for a new kind of romance. Alex Miranda, who loves a good horse ride, has the story.</p>
<p>I thought it was hard to date in 2021. Imagine trying to find a match in 1851, in between milking the cows.</p>
<p>In &#8220;The World to Come,&#8221; it is a whole new world for Vanessa Kirby after she meets Katherine Waterston.</p>
<p>Vanessa Kirby (as Tallie): &#8220;I hope I&#8217;m not keeping you from something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Katherine Waterston (as Abigail): &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is love on the horizon? In the new romance drama &#8220;The World to Come,&#8221; Vanessa Kirby and Katherine Waterston star as two farmers&#8217; wives who can&#8217;t take their eyes off each other.</p>
<p>But with husbands, and in the 19th century, this love affair isn&#8217;t an easy swipe-right situation.</p>
<p>Christopher Abbott (as Finney): &#8220;I have a wife. I have certain expectations, and you have certain duties.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;Before they even speak, there&#8217;s that look.&#8221;</p>
<p>Katherine Waterston: &#8220;For a moment, the whole world falls away, and even the possible repercussions fall away. Maybe you feel braver than you normally are, and then reality comes back in.&#8221;</p>
<p>That reality? Not so hot: unhappy marriages, hard labor, pigs.</p>
<p>But when this new friendship blossoms into something more&#8230;</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;These moments between the two of you were just so intense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vanessa Kirby: &#8220;More than, &#8216;You&#8217;re really good-looking, and I want to smooch you.&#8217; It&#8217;s more like, &#8216;I see you, and I see something in you that I have in me, and I haven&#8217;t seen someone that has allowed me to see that.'&#8221;</p>
<p>But how does one date in, uh, 1851?</p>
<p>Katherine Waterston: &#8220;A lot of schlepping, really, on the part of Tallie, over to my house, so often unannounced. No way to shoot that text saying, &#8216;I&#8217;ll be around in an hour.'&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll stick to Tinder, but it could have helped this same-sex couple.</p>
<p>Katherine Waterston: &#8220;They were free to fall, at least, without the pressures and constraints of society to deny them that opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>In some more good news, Vanessa was just nominated for a 2021 Golden Globe.</p>
<p>Vanessa Kirby: &#8220;I&#8217;m just smilingm Katherine, because, look at that, she&#8217;s such a proud mom. I&#8217;m so happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s for her portrayal of a woman who&#8217;s grieving over a heartbreaking home birth in the Netflix drama, &#8220;Pieces of a Woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;Now, do you have an acceptance speech prepared?&#8221;</p>
<p>Vanessa Kirby: &#8220;No, no, no, no, no. You can&#8217;t do that. Obviously, deeply honored, and still can&#8217;t quite believe it. I can&#8217;t quite &#8212; like when you say it, I&#8217;m like, &#8216;Wait, what? Who?'&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The World to Come&#8221; is now playing in select theaters, and then it&#8217;ll go up on demand March 2nd.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Love is in the air. Just in case you need a reminder, Valentine&#8217;s Day is this weekend! Flowers, chocolate and an expensive dinner are so 2020. This year, think outside of the box and go somewhere unexpected.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re pulling out all the stops at Pincho on Flagler at their Not-Your-Typical Valentine pop-up.</p>
<p>Otto Othman, Pincho: &#8220;We&#8217;re changing Pincho Flagler location to be, like, a really awesome, like, fine dining feel, but super chill, so, you know, candlelight, all of our tables with black tablecloths, really cool silverware, music.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hey, this is fancy stuff. It&#8217;s not something you would normally find at the restaurant.</p>
<p>In fact, the pop-up is a perfect love match for Evelyn Blanch and her honey, Gaston.</p>
<p>Evelyn Blanch, customer: &#8220;Sometimes, when you think of Valentine&#8217;s Day, you think you need to go to some place really fancy, but it&#8217;s always about the company and the good food.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking of food, this fine dining experience costs $20 per person, but make sure you go hungry.</p>
<p>Otto Othman: &#8220;We gonna start with vaca frita tacos, and we&#8217;re also gonna have you guys taste pork belly pinchos with California salad with the original mango dressing, and right after that, you&#8217;re gonna get a naughty burger with Cajun fries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whew! You better wear stretchy pants because there&#8217;s more..</p>
<p>Otto Othman: &#8220;And to finish the night, we&#8217;re gonna serve our deep fried banana caramel cheese cake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, if that don&#8217;t put you in a loving mood, we don&#8217;t know what will.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Netflix is in the pole position with a new documentary. &#8220;Strip Down, Rise Up&#8221; explores pole dancing and the incredible impact it can have on the women who really get into it.</p>
<p>Sheila Kelley (in &#8220;Strip Down, Rise Up&#8221;): &#8220;Some people come in just to learn how to pole dance, and their minds are blown open that it touches a part of themselves that they didn&#8217;t know they had.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheila Kelley (in &#8220;Strip Down, Rise Up&#8221;): &#8220;I want you to move your body.&#8221;</p>
<p>Woman (in &#8220;Strip Down, Rise Up&#8221;): &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the J-Lo movie, &#8220;Hustlers.&#8221; This documentary dives deep.</p>
<p>It takes a look at how this physical activity can be so meaningful and healing for your mind, body and spirit.</p>
<p>We chatted with the director and one of the amazing dancers featured in the film.</p>
<p>Michèle Ohayon, director: &#8220;It is definitely a call for action. I want to inspire women to be able to look into the mirror and see the beauty that they have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amy Bond, dancer and studio owner: &#8220;I think the movie really focuses on healing journeys, and how women have reclaimed their sexuality through pole dancing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amy also made an important distinction: the sexuality she&#8217;s talking about has nothing to do with the male gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Strip Down, Rise Up&#8221; is streaming on Netflix.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Total coincidence: Fox&#8217;s new game show is named &#8220;Cherries Wild,&#8221; and Shireen and Lynn know a woman named Cherries Wild. Well, that&#8217;s just her stage name. Anyway, here&#8217;s the Fox-friendly &#8220;Cherries Wild.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jason Biggs is best known for his passionate love of baked goods in &#8220;American Pie.&#8221;</p>
<p>But man does not live by pie alone. Now, Jason is hosting Fox&#8217;s new game show, &#8220;Cherries Wild.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jason Biggs: &#8220;My wife pointed out to me earlier, she&#8217;s like, &#8216;You know, between &#8216;American Pie,&#8217; &#8216;Orange Is the New Black&#8217; and now &#8216;Cherries Wild,&#8217; I&#8217;ve got a thing for fruit. I don&#8217;t really know what that thing is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s really wild: Jason has always wanted to host a game show.</p>
<p>Jason Biggs: &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a very specific skill set that, when done right, is really fun to watch. I&#8217;m not saying that I&#8217;m doing it right, but I always thought, &#8216;Hey, I&#8217;d love to get a crack at it.'&#8221;</p>
<p>This is how it works. Teams answer trivia questions for a chance to pull the handle of a 30-foot slot machine. If they get five wild cherries, they win $250,000.</p>
<p>If he wasn&#8217;t hosting, Jason says he&#8217;d be a great contestant because he has mad trivia skills.</p>
<p>Jason Biggs: &#8220;I&#8217;m usually the one dropping the bombs in our family when it comes to sort of pop culture information, and I sort of ingest all of it via Twitter, mostly, follow various magazines and websites, and so forth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The show premieres on Valentine&#8217;s Day, and Jason promises to give his fans a night to remember &#8212; with cherries on top.</p>
<p>Jason Biggs: &#8220;I think there&#8217;s so many people out there that have crushes on me, you know, from when they were growing up with the &#8216;American Pie&#8217; movies, and I just feel like, what better way to give back to them than to let them tune in to &#8216;Cherries Wild'&#8221;?</p>
<p>Tune in to the premiere of &#8220;Cherries Wild,&#8221; Sunday at 7 p.m., right here on 7.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Chinese New Year falls on Friday. What could be better than that &#8212; falling on a Friday?</p>
<p>Well, I guess a few things, like fabulous food, delicious drinks and traditional Chinese entertainment at one of the best hotels in all of SoFlo.</p>
<p>Happy Chinese New Year!</p>
<p>At the Mandarin Oriental Miami, the festivities start right when you walk in.</p>
<p>Shara Kirton, Mandarin Oriental Miami: &#8220;There are red lanterns hanging from the ceiling. There&#8217;s a giant lucky tree with red envelopes dangling from each stem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, we need all the luck we can get in 2021.</p>
<p>Shara Kirton: &#8220;[Guests] go to the front desk. pick up an envelope. write down their intentions for 2021.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, hang them up.</p>
<p>I went with a couple of practical options, and then one for me.</p>
<p>Just make sure to pick a lower branch if you weren&#8217;t lucky in the height department.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s any New Year&#8217;s celebration without entertainment?</p>
<p>Shara Kirton: &#8220;We have our traditional lion dance performances, but this year, for 2021, we are kicking it up a notch.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Lee Koon Kung Lion Dance Team perform Friday at MO Bar + Lounge, and again Saturday at La Mar by Gaston Acurio.</p>
<p>While I may have had some some luck on the drums, the lion dance&#8230;</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;I&#8217;m terrible! Happy New Year, but I&#8217;m going to leave it to the experts.&#8221;</p>
<p>I need a drink. Take me to the bar!</p>
<p>Shara Kirton: &#8220;In honor of the Year of the Ox, we have an Oxley Gin-based cocktail called Sip for Luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alex Miranda: &#8220;I&#8217;m just hoping that I&#8217;m lucky by Valentine&#8217;s Day so it&#8217;s not another year of drinking alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, that sounded pretty depressing. On to the food!</p>
<p>Shara Kirton: &#8220;MO Bar + Lounge is offering delicious Asian-inspired dishes, including pork and shrimp shumai, and dan dan noodles, which is my favorite.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over at the restaurant&#8230;</p>
<p>Shara: &#8220;The long life noodles and ming pao steamed buns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hmmm. I may have to rethink that one intention from earlier.</p>
<p>The way you say &#8220;Happy New Year&#8221; in Cantonese is &#8220;kung hei fat choy,&#8221; and I gotta say, at the Mandarin Oriental Miami, it&#8217;s a very happy Chinese New Year.</p>
